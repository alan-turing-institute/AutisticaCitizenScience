# Newsletter | 23 April 2020

*Date sent: 23 April 2020*

Hello, 

We hope you're doing well.
We know these must be stressful and challenging times for many, and community is more important than ever.
For those wanting support, Autistica has published a range of autism-specific resources to help people through the cornovirus pandemic.
You can access them by following this link: https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/coronavirus


## Project News 

We know it has been a long time since we updated you about the Autistica/Turing citizen science project.
We hope you enjoy all the updates on our last few months of work!

### Focus Group summaries
Thanks to everyone who took part in the focus groups last autumn, and who reviewed the summaries. 
The dataset is published online and you can check the insights out here: https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/community-recommendations/focus-groups.

> (*A* *P* d): "…it’s not just expert advice, everyone is…coming from their life experience, from their relative’s experience, and they’re saying, 'it helped someone, I'm sure it would help others', so I think a project like this is important"

*Quote from a autistic person who is a parent of an autistic person explaining the value of the project, from the [4 October](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/community-recommendations/focus-groups/20191004_summary-4-October-2019.html) focus group*

### To-do list 

We're creating actions based on your feedback, including from the focus groups and the online survey, and making them into a collection of issues on GitHub (which is basically a public to-do list).

You can view them online, add tasks of your own, make comments, or let us know if you think something should be especially prioritised. 

:point_right: Follow this link: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues.

### Wireframes

The Fujitsu team has started working on designs from the platform.
You can see a demo video of their latest work on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f6kn5HLysc

If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions about the wireframe, you can:

* Put your comments in our [always open google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_9MW3r4nsGUDxGWN24X88hqtz6q_347DC1gbMc_Yzj2Hrcg/viewform)
* Get in touch with the team directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).
  You will need to create an account, but you don't have to provide your real name or any details.  
* Email Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk)

### Blog

Otis Smith, who is an autistic collarborator on the citizen science project, and Georgia Aitkenhead, a Turing researcher, co-authored a blog to celebrate World Autism Awareness Day. You can read the blog here: https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/world-autism-awareness-day-celebration-and-citizen-science

### Workshop

Wireframing workshop: On the 27th March we ran a wireframing workshop over Zoom. 
The workshop was a mix of people from Autistica, Fujitsu, the Turing, and community members. 
You can see the notes from the meeting by following this link: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/GeorgiaHCA-wireframing-workshop/project-management/workshops/wireframing-March2020-notes.md

# Upcoming opportunities

### User testing

We've started running user testing sessions with the Fujitsu team, and we're looking for people to help give feedback. 

These will take place remotely by videocall, and you will be paid in line with involve guidelines for you time. 

Please look out for an email from Autistica! 

You can get in touch with Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) if you'd like to be involved  or if you would prefer any adjustments to be made. 

We will only be looking for one person for each session, but the sessions will reccur regularly while the platform is being built.

### Social Meet-ups 

A few of you have said that you'd like to connect with people involved in the project in a social setting and would be interested in getting to know each other better and meeting new people! :smiley:. 
One way to do it would be to have a time slot for people to join a videocall and chat if they want to. 

It would be great to hear from you about:
* whether you would be interested in having a regular time slot for an online social meeting
* what activities might be fun to do? Some thoughts from the community so far are:
    * an open discussion
    * a quiz 
    * a reading group
* when would be a good time for you? Any times you definitely can't do? 
* The Turing can host a videocall on Zoom, how would this suit you? 

Please get in touch with Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) if you'd like to give your thoughts or be involved! 

# Introducing Otis

Every month, we've decided to introduce a new member of the community to show the range of people involved in the project and the variety of contributions they're making.
If you'd like to be interviewed, or to interview someone else, please get in touch with Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk

This month, we're delighted to introduce Otis Smith. 

Otis has been involved in multiple aspects of the project, including giving feedback on designs, presentations, and agendas; helping to design the labelling system for the focus group summaries; helping to prioritise tasks; giving ideas and insights in workshops; and co-authoring the blog written for World Autism Awareness day. 
He also co-wrote this newsletter!  

Here he is:

And here he is in his own words:

> My name is Otis Smith.
> 
> I live in South East London.
> 
> One of my hobbies is go to libraries or galleries.
> 
> Things I dislike are sport or anything contact-related, large crowds or noise.
> 
> My ultimate gift is seeing and making others happy.
> 
> My role is a Facilities Assistant at the Alan Turing Institute.
> 
> Since being diagnosed with autism, I have learnt various ways to engage and interact with others.
> 
> My experience of autism is hit and miss: some days are good, other days not so.
> 
> I have always had difficulties from even when I was at a younger age.
> 
> I didn’t realise it would involve so much compromise. 
> 
> At the same time, the diagnosis was the push I needed to get on track.
> 
> I joined the citizen science project because it was an opportunity that was too good to resist.
> 
> I was keen on taking part in the hope of expanding my knowledge and offering any help possible to improve the lives of autistic people.
> 
> I would hope my contributions to the project provide information that many people can benefit from and relate to.
> 
> It is not like anything I have done before.
> 
> The project is important in more ways than one: 
> 
> To make a difference to autistic people
> 
> To ‘spread the word’ about autism 
> 
> To create something that will have long-lasting but effective results.
> 
> This project is only the start of many great things to come: autistic people are powerful when we work together. 
> 
> Others should be involved because it isn’t like anything you’ve done before.
> 
> You can gather new ideas or inspiration by being on board.
> 
> Having more people on board will be a great help.
> 
> It will be the turning point that leads to open doors.
> 
> The environments we build now and the understanding we build are not just for today or tomorrow but for future generations.

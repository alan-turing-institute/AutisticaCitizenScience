## Platform Development

From April 2020 until mid-December 2020, work was ongoing with an agile development team provided by Fujitsu, Autistica’s corporate partner, who gave pro bono support. 
During this time:

* Various ways of working were iterated. 
Agile/Open Source research methods were designed and implemented. 
The protocols and theory were shared and explained to the team, and have been openly published on GitHub in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.
* This phase of development gave the opportunity for important experimentation and learning.
* Accessibility research was undertaken by the Fujitsu team’s designer, whose work is openly published on the AutisticaCitizenScience repository. 
Much of this is relevant to ongoing designs and can be incorporated. 
This accessibility-focussed research uses axshare.
* 10 sprint reports were submitted by the Fujitsu agile team. 
They are published in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository. 
* 9 videos were released in order to showcase work done on the project by the agile development team. 
They are published in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.
* 5 sessions of user testing were run with a diverse group of autistic users, including those with co-occurring conditions such as learning difficulties, dyslexia, and anxiety. 
These sessions were done with the support of doctoral student from CRI. 
They were adapted for individuals so those with complex needs could take part. 
The sessions were run virtually over Zoom, summarised, published on GitHub in note form, and used to iteratively modify the platform. 
They are available on the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.
* The repository was redesigned to make it more accessible. 
This was done through a card sort, file restructuring, and input from autistic individuals.

December 2020 saw the wrap up and handover of Fujitsu’s work.
This initiated a new phase of design and development.
During this time:

* A new AutSPACEs GitHub repository was set up under an open source license for the development of the platform. 
A README was created that includes development and project information, resources and a step-by-step guide to building the platform locally.
* A new set of wireframes were created and then iterated. 
First as a sketch, and then a more detailed version was created using Figma. 
To start development, an MVP or “simplified” version of that design was also created using Figma. 
This was then turned into a basic clickable html wireframe to demonstrate how interaction on the platform might function. 
* A requirements list for the platform was created by combining multiple sources of participatory input, including focus groups, the results of user testing, the results of one-to-one collaboration work, and online feedback. 
This is published online on the AutSPACEs repository.
* A series of issues reflecting the requirements were written on Asana and moved gradually over to GitHub. 
These issues are also available on Trello. 
All issues worked on will be publicly visible on the AutSPACEs GitHub repository.
* A new developer who provides pro bono support to further develop the platform was brought on board. 
He has so far contributed through a combination of independent working, upskilling others, and co-working with researchers.
* An infrastructure skeleton for the AutSPACEs platform has been built using the Django web development framework, and has been successfully integrated with the backend provided by Open Humans. 
This completes the first milestone of this phase of platform development.
* By April 01 2021, the second milestone is midway complete, with work still to be done on clarifying tasks in issues so they are suitable for an open source community of developers. 
A project board was set up to track overall progress. 
This is available in the AutSPACEs repository.
* Open Source components which are accessible to diverse users, user-tested, and well-documented for reuse, have been researched for potential use in the ongoing development of the platform.
* Accessibility checklists based on GOV.UK guidance have been created and built into issues so that platform releases meet these requirements.
* We have worked with autistic collaborators to redesign elements of the project management repository including the labelling of issues and milestones, to make them more suitable to autistic participants. 
This work is ongoing.
* An online focus group and co-creation session was run on the 30th November to understand issues and priorities concerning the platform moderation process. 
These discussions included a combination of autistic people, the parents of autistic people, and those who were in both categories. The session has now been fully transcribed (107 pages of human transcription). 
These will now be summarised, grouped, and shared with participants for their review and consent. 
They will then be openly published on GitHub in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.
* Further interest and discussions were instigated as a result of the moderation session and engagement with researchers has continued. 
This has provided further insights and creates the possibility of even deeper community involvement and direction-setting in the moderation process.
* The “skeleton” code of conduct was created by combining the guidelines for the Autistica/Turing citizen science project using open source best practices, with the code of conduct developed by autistic people for the AutAngels autistic community.
This is now being openly worked on by researchers including autistic collaborators in an open Google Doc.
* Throughout the year, there has been continued community growth. We have had enthusiastic interest and collaboration from new autistic members, new developers, and people from within the Turing. 
Ongoing collaboration has been encouraged through a combination of individual one to one sessions and group working. 
Substantiary voluntary contributions have been made, and individual working relationships with a number of key autistic volunteers has been maintained. 
We are extremely grateful to our autistic collaborators.
* Work on the branding and communications design of the platform is being done collaboratively using the unique skills of autistic individuals. 
The name “AutSPACEs” was chosen for the platform after consultation by community members.
* We’re delighted to have received positive feedback from autistic participants about their experience as members of the citizen science project. 
Participation has resulted in significant results for many autistic collaborators.

## Outreach and collaboration
 
* The project was accepted into the second cohort of the Open Life Sciences leadership programme to be developed over the course of 3 months with the support of expert mentors and peers. 
Researcher Georgia Aitkenhead graduated from the programme on 17th December 2020. 
Outputs included an Open Canvas, a road map,  a detailed project people, skills, and resources map, structuring and initiating work on a chapter for The Turing Way, and valuable upskilling and networking with an open source community. 
A highly positive working relationship was formed with the OLS mentor, who is delivering ongoing mentorship to a project researcher.
* Contribution to The Hidden REF: The Hidden REF is a movement designed to publicly credit and support contributors to science who are often under-acknowledged. 
Based on learning gained from the participatory science, we proposed a new category of submissions for The Hidden REF called "lived experience". 
We hope it will help recognise the value participants bring to science through their personal expertise, gained through their daily lives.
* The project was submitted and accepted by the INCF to receive intern applicants for Google Summer of Code. 
An exercise was created as a GitHub issue to assess applicants’ ability to work on the platform and understand the complexity of the project. 
Two applicants completed our assessment. 
The next upcoming phase is applicant submissions. 
* Bi-weekly community meet-up and co-working sessions were set up. 
These involve collective discussion and group work among a diverse group of participants, including researchers, developers, and autistic citizen scientists. 
Additional outreach efforts and accommodations have been made for those with co-occurring conditions, such as autism and anxiety, autism and dyslexia, autism and learning difficulties and autism and dyspraxia. 
* Work is ongoing on a chapter for The Turing Way on Participatory Science, using AutSPACEs as a case study. 
The chapter is being co-written with a citiizen scientist and strategist giving pro bono support. 
* Findings and learning from the project have been shared with groups throughout The Alan Turing Institute. 
A participatory science co-working group was set up with researchers from Google DeepMind and learning from the project was shared with members. 
Project researcher Georgia Aitkenhead became a co-lead of the Social Data Sciences Special Interest Group and has presented this project with group members, as well as facilitating a collaborator from Open Humans to share knowledge with The Turing.

## Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress
 
Despite much effort, the project is behind schedule in delivering the platform according to the original projected delivery date. This is due to the following challenges: 
 
### COVID-19 disruptions
 
PI Kirstie Whitaker had only limited capacity to work on the project for much of 2020 due to urgent, covid-related work. 
Adaptations had to be made as a result of not being able to meet in person, creating challenges for co-working, focus groups, and discussion groups. 
Covid restrictions impacted on Autistica, the project’s funder, who had less capacity to offer their expert support to the project. 
Further, many autistic participants were impacted by anxiety, depression and other negative effects due to the pandemic. 
 
## Nature of project
 
A major goal of the project is to innovate new ways of conducting research so that it is open and participatory. 
This means that there is a constant process of designing, learning, and refining ways of working. 
We are committed to the integrity of the project through facilitating diverse autistic participation and creating opportunities which benefit them throughout the research cycle. 
We are also committed to open research and open working. 
These aspects can take additional time and make timelines harder to predict.

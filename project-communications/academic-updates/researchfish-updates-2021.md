### Award Abstract

#### Lay Summary

Autistica and the Alan Turing Institute are working together to build a participatory, citizen science project to gather data on how sensory processing affects autistic people’s navigation of the world.
Numerous studies into sensory processing and autism have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences, and that this can significantly impact their lives. 
One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments.  

This project is to build a platform to gather autistic people’s experiences of navigating their environment at scale.
Our goals are to better understand and represent the commonalities and individual differences in autistic people’s experiences navigating the world. 
We will identify the barriers they face and solutions to overcome these challenges.

The citizen scientists who contribute their data to this project will be autistic people, and their relatives and carers. 
The main target audience for this work are non-autistic people, including, but are not limited to, employers, friends and family, urban planners, architects and interior designers for hospitals, schools and community spaces.  

The work will be participatory from the ground up. 
All aspects of the project will be designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community.
The platform will be developed under a free and open source license and will be built openly from the beginning. 
We commit to re-using – with credit – open source projects that already exist rather than re-inventing the wheel. 

The project will follow best-practice principles in open-source development, including extensive documentation for both users and contributors as well as an open governance structure. 
A diverse group of contributors of all levels of experience will be encouraged to join the community.  

The data will be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) and made available under a managed access agreement for future research projects. 
A fine-grained consent model will be developed to support individual contributor’s personal preferences on how their data is used on the platform. 
No data will be shared without explicit consent from the citizen scientist who uploads it, or from the autistic person if a relative or carer is uploading the information.

## Research Tools and Methods

**Material Type**	Improvements to research infrastructure

**Material Name**	Participatory co-creation of a qualitative dataset. 

**Description**	The creation of the Focus Groups dataset was done using a new participatory method. A key was developed to highlight relevant categories individuals fall into as part of the dataset, a decision resulting from discussion sessions with the autistic community. The key was co-designed with Otis Smith, an autistic citizen scientist. In particular, Smith innovated a tag to distinguish between the direct and indirect reporting of experiences. 

**Provided to Others**	Yes

**Year First Provided** 2019

**Impact Description**	Differentiating betwen direct and indirect reporting is not a standard practice in qualitative research anaysis, but coud be a useful way of addressing a common complaint by autistic people that their experiences are often spoken about or over by others, and that this prevents them from being directly consulted and listened to. 

The value of making a distinction between direct and indirect reporting has been attested to by autistic people in subsequent discussion sessions.

* Small number of people or appropriate people are difficult to engage
* Lack of resources to support effective involvement
* Difficulty in finding appropriate ways to communicate and engage,Concerns about how 'representative' views are
* 
**Why was involving people challenging?**	
* Difference made by patient involvement	
Our research is fundamentally participatory, and we have actively engaged and recruited members of the affected community. 
This is a community of people on the autism spectrum, their relatives, carers, and allies. 

Their work has been core to a number of dimensions: determining the research question; setting the direction of the project; inputting their concerns and desired outputs; designing the methods of the study, co-authoring papers, attending stakeholder meetings, and strategising methods. 

As such, their involvement has been critical to the research direction, content, and progress. 

We remain committed to research for and by autistic people, and have been meticulous in ensuring diverse autistic people, including those with complex needs and co-occurring conditions, are involved throughout in a way which is respectful and empowering. 

Our ongoing platform development is also rigorously based on recommendations from the community.     
Furthermore, a key research goal has been to empower autistic participants through their involvement. 
There have been some highly significant outcomes for autistic individuals. Here is a selection:     
	* Autistic adult with epilepsy: after setbacks following illness and coronavirus disruptions, being inspired to enter into autism research, applying for a master's course, and delivering own research at a postgraduate-level conference.  
	* Autistic adult with dyspraxia: becoming a neurodiversity advocate at thier workplace and being inspired to apply for a secondment to The Alan Turinig Institute.  
	* Autistica adult and parent of autistic individual: being empowered to have her voice heard and to have a tangible impact on adjustments to environments to make them more neurodiverse in additional contexts.   
	* Autistic adult: found the project invaluable in dealing with mental health difficulties exacerbated by Covid-19.

## Annual Progress

Details of progress	01-04-2020 - 31-03-2021    

### Platform Development    

From April 2020 until mid-December 2020, work was ongoing with an agile development team provided by Fujitsu, Autistica’s corporate partner, who gave pro bono support.
During this time:  
* Various ways of working were iterated. 
* Agile/Open Source research methods were designed and implemented. * The protocols and theory were shared and explained to the team, and have been openly published on GitHub in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.  
* This phase of development gave the opportunity for important experimentation and learning.  
* Accessibility research was undertaken by the Fujitsu team’s designer, Christopher Legg, whose work is openly published on the AutisticaCitizenScience repository. 
Much of this is relevant to ongoing designs and can be incorporated. 
This accessibility focussed research uses axshare.  
* 10 sprint reports were submitted by the Fujitsu agile team. 
They are published in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.   
9 videos were released in order to showcase work done on the project by the agile development team. 
They are published in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.  
5 sessions of user testing were run with a diverse group of autistic users, including those with co-occurring conditions such as learning difficulties, dyslexia, and anxiety. 
These sessions were done with the support of a doctoral student from CRI. 
They were adapted for individuals so those with complex needs could take part. 
The sessions were run virtually over Zoom, summarised, published on GitHub in note form, and used to iteratively modify the platform. 
They are available on the AutisticaCitizenScience repository.  
* The repository was redesigned to make it more accessible. This was done through a card sort, file restructuring, and input from autistic individuals.  

December 2020 saw the wrap up and handover of Fujitsu’s work. 
This initiated a new phase of design and development:
* A new AutSPACEs GitHub repository was set up under an open source license for the development of the platform. 
* A README was created that includes development and project information, resources and a step-by-step guide to building the platform locally. 
* A detailed Roadmap is now being produced.   
* A new set of wireframes were created and then iterated. First as a sketch, and then a more detailed version created using Figma. 
* To start development, an MVP or “simplified” version of that design was also created using Figma. This was then turned into a basic clickable html wireframe to demonstrate how interaction on the platform might function.   
* A requirements list for the platform was created by combining multiple sources of participatory input, including focus groups, the results of user testing, the results of one-to-one collaboration work, and online feedback. 
* This is published online on the AutSPACEs repository.  
* A series of issues reflecting the requirements were written on Asana and moved gradually over to GitHub. 
These issues are also available on Trello. 
All issues worked on will be publicly visible on the AutSPACEs GitHub repository.  
* A new developer who provides pro bono support to further develop the platform, was brought on board. 
He has so far contributed through a combination of independent working, upskilling others, and co-working with researchers.  
* An infrastructure skeleton for the AutSPACEs platform has been built using the Django web development framework, and has been successfully integrated with the backend provided by Open Humans. 
This completes the first milestone of this phase of platform development.  
* By May 2021, the second milestone is underway, with work still to be done on clarifying tasks in issues so they are suitable for an open source community of developers. 
A project board was set up to track overall progress. 
This is available in the AutSPACEs repository. 
A project board was set up to track overall progress. This is available in the AutSPACEs repository.
* We were delighted to have an intern and a Google Summer of Code student join us to further develop the platform. 
* Open Source components which are accessible to diverse users, user-tested, and well-documented for reuse, have been researched for potential use in the ongoing development of the platform.  
* Accessibility checklists based on GOV.UK guidance have been created and built into issues so that platform releases meet these requirements.  
* We have worked with autistic collaborators to redesign elements of the project management repository including the labelling of issues and milestones, to make them more suitable to autistic participants. This work is ongoing.  
* An online focus group and co-creation session was run on the 30th November to understand issues and priorities concerning the platform moderation process. These discussions included a combination of autistic people, the parents of autistic people, and those who were in both categories. 
* The session has now been fully transcribed (107 pages of human transcription). These will now be summarised, grouped, and shared with participants for their review and consent. 
They will be openly published on GitHub in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository. 
* Further interest and discussions were instigated as a result of the moderation session and engagement with researchers has continued. This has provided further insights and creates the possibility of even deeper community involvement and direction-setting in the moderation process. Two autistic citizen sciences are now leading on the moderation co-design work on GitHub using participatory co-creative methods.  
* The “skeleton” code of conduct was created by combining the guidelines for the Autistica/Turing citizen science project using open source best practices, with the code of conduct developed by autistic people for the AutAngels autistic community.
This is now being openly worked on by researchers including autistic collaborators in an open Google Doc and via. co-working sessions and GitHub.
* Issues and Pull requests: from April 01 2020 - March 31 2021:    114 Pull Requestss were made to the AutisticaCitizenScience repository. 
107 PRs were closed, of which 88 were merged.  
291 issues were created in the AutisticaCitizenScience repository and 210 issues were closed.  
29 PR were made to the AutSPACEs repository. 
26 PR were closed, of which 17 were merged. 
(The high number of closed PRs is due to a number of individual PR for different pages of a wireframe, which were replaced by a single, combined PR)  
92 issues created on the AutSPACEs repository and 44 issues were closed.

### Outreach and collaboration     

* The project was accepted into the second cohort of the Open Life Sciences leadership programme to be developed over the course of 3 months with the support of expert mentors and peers. 
The project's research associate graduated from the programme on 17th December 2020. 
* Outputs included an Open Canvas, a road map,  a detailed project people, skills, and resources map, structuring and initiating work on a chapter for The Turing Way, and valuable upskilling and networking with an open source community.   
* A highly positive working relationship was formed with the OLS mentor, who is providing ongoing mentorship to project researchers.  * Contribution to The Hidden REF: The Hidden REF is a movement designed to publicly credit and support contributors to science who are often under-acknowledged. 
* Based on learning gained from the participatory science, we proposed a new category of submissions for The Hidden REF called "lived experience". 
* We hope it will help recognise the value participants bring to science through their personal expertise, gained through their daily lives.    
* The project was submitted and accepted by the INCF to receive intern applicants for Google Summer of Code. An exercise was created as a GitHub issue to assess applicants’ ability to work on the platform and understand the complexity of the project. Two applicants completed our assessment. We are delighted that a GSOC student has met our requirements and has now been accepted to join the project over the summer. 
* Bi-weekly community meet-up and co-working sessions were set up.
These involve collective discussion and group work among a diverse group of participants, including researchers, developers, and autistic citizen scientists. 
Additional outreach efforts and accommodations have been made for those with co-occurring conditions, such as autism and anxiety, autism and dyslexia, autism and learning difficulties and autism and dyspraxia.
A highly skilled civiil service fast streamer who joined in April has now been able to begin succesfully leading these meet-ups, as well as more generally the community management of the project.
* Work is ongoing on a chapter for The Turing Way on Participatory Science, using AutSPACEs as a case study. 
The chapter is being co-written with autistic researcher and strategist who joined the projcet as a citizen scientist.      
* Findings and learning from the project have been shared with groups throughout The Alan Turing Institute. 
A participatory science co-working group was set up with researchers from Google DeepMind and learning from the project was shared with members. 
Findings and learning from the project have been shared with groups throughout The Alan Turing Institute. 
A participatory science co-working group was set up with researchers from Google DeepMind and learning from the project was shared with members. 
The project's research associate became a co-lead of the Social Data Sciences Special Interest Group and has presented this project with group members, as well as a facilitating collaborator from The Open Humans Foundation to share knowledge with The Turing.

## Participatory Science    
We remain committed to research for and by autistic people, and have been highly meticulous in ensuring diverse autistic people, including those with complex needs or co-occuding conditions, are involved throughout in a way which is respectful and empowering. 
Our ongoing platform development is also rigorously based on recommendations from the community.    
Throughout the year, there has been continued community growth. 
We have had enthusiastic interest and collaboration from new autistic members, new developers, and people from within the Turing. 
We have also brought on new members to help support collaboration, progress, and provide mentorship. 
Ongoing collaboration has been encouraged through a combination of individual one to one sessions and group working. 
Substantial voluntary contributions have been made, and individual working relationships with a number of key autistic volunteers has been maintained. 
We are extremely grateful to our autistic collaborators.   
* Work on the branding and communications design of the platform is being done collaboratively using the unique skills of autistic individuals. 
The name “AutSPACEs” was chosen for the platform after consultation by community members. 
The acronym stands for our aim of invistigating Autistic Sensory Processing for Accessible Community Environments.     
* We are delighted to have received positive and often moving accounts from participants about their experience as members of the citizen science project. 
* Participation has resulted in significant results for many autistic collaborators. These include:  being supported through the challenges of COVID19 by being a part of the community.

## Did you have any challenges and how did you overcome them?	

#### COVID-19 disruptions   

* PI Kirstie Whitaker had only limited capacity to work on the project for much of 2020 due to urgent, covid-related work. 
Adaptations had to be made as a result of not being able to meet in person, creating challenges for co-working, focus groups, and discussion groups. 
Further, many autistic participants were impacted by anxiety due to the pandemic.      

* Nature of project   
A major goal of the project is to innovate new ways of conducting research so that it is open and participatory. 
This means that there is a constant process of designing, learning, and refining ways of working. 
We are committed to the integrity of the project through facilitating diverse autistic participation and creating opportunities which benefit them throughout the research cycle. 
We are also committed to open research and open working. 
These aspects can take additional time and make timelines harder to predict.    
All these difficulties relate to the time taken to develop the AutSPACEs platform. 
To overcome the above challenges, we intend to:  
* Bring in collaborators to specifically focus on platform development and community management, so that the project can broken up into more manageable areas. This is now being implemented.  
* Develop an effective onboarding process, documentation, repository, and online presence to support an open source community to easily contribute to the project. 
We will use The Turing Way findings and community to do this.
* Seek more involvement of the Whitaker Lab in mentoring researchers as well as additional training.  
* Extend the project research associate's contract for a further 8 months using funds from The Alan Turing Institute.    
* Seek funding for the expansion of the platform given its range of potential applications. 
This would be via. funding for better understanding co-occuring conditions, a key concern of autistic participants. 
Securing this funding would increase sustainability and the future impact of the project.

We had a great AutSPACEs community meet-up today where we split into different breakout rooms to focus on different aspects of the project. This included both a space for ***X*** and a space for ***X*** . In the main room we focused on ***X***

I would LOVE for anyone who attended this session to comment on this thread with what you did today and what your key take-aways from the session were.

* learn something new

Feel free to come for some or all of the session. You don't need to join for the whole two hours unless you want to. 

If you are interested but don't know how you want to be involved yet we can help you choose something. 

You can also join in with your camera switched off if you would like to see what it's all about before you take part. No pressure to take part in anything unless you want to.

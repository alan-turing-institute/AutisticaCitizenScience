# Project communications

As part of our commitment to openness and transparency, we actively engage with the our community of participants, commuinicate the project's progress, and disseminate our findings so others can learn from them. We publish many of our communications openly and you can view them in this folder. 

## Contents

### [Newsletters](project-communications/newsletter)
We send regular updates to our community to keep them updated on how the project is progressing.
This directory contains the original versions of these newsletters for our records and to make them easy to re-use in the future.

### [Presentations](project-communications/presentations)
When we deliver presentations, we publish our slides openly on Zenodo.org. This folder contains links to those slides. 
For resources on creating presentations and some template slides, please visit the [design-resources](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-resources/) folder.

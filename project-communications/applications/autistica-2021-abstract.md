# Autistica Research Festival 2021 - abstract proposal

*This is an abstract submitted for the Autistica 2021 research festival by Susanna Fantoni, Georgia Aitkenhead, and James Scott.* 

We will present new research concerning a unique, co-created moderation process for a participatory citizen-science platform: AutSPACEs. 
AutSPACEs is a research platform being designed by and for autistic people and their allies, to share their experiences of sensory processing in their daily lives. 
The data collected can then be gathered to modify environments so that they are better suited to autistic people.

Crucial to the success of the platform is an effective moderation process that allows autistic people to feel safe but not censored, heard but not misheard, and welcomed as individuals as part of a community. 
It is vital that a diverse group of neurodivergent people are both enabled and protected. 
Rather than a top-down approach where rules created by moderators are imposed on users, we demonstrate a participatory co-creative process in which all members are invited to take part in designing and maintaining a moderation process for autistic people in particular.


The talk will be given by a non-autistic researcher and two autistic participant researchers. 
We will begin by briefly setting the context and describing the co-creation process, as well as highlighting some of the complexities and themes emerging. 
We will go on to discuss challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies identified. 
We will then consider the implications of allowing non-autistic people to speak for autistic people in special cases. 
Finally, we will invite attendees to participate in creating the moderation process themselves.

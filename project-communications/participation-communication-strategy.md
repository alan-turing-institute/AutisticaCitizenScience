# Participation and Communication Strategy

This is where you will find all information and strategic direction of our communicaion and engagement to ensure participation on the AutSPACEs Project. 

## Mountain of Engagement

Our Mountain of Engagement can be seem in the below image. 

It shows the levels of engagement and paritcipation that there is within the Project. 
It is important to note that there is not a hierarchy in realtion to how important you are to the project. 
Each level is crucial and essential to the success of the project. 

The MoE allows us to map out where contributors lie and where we can provide opportunities to allow individuals to increase their participation to the next level. 
A key difference between each level in the responsibility the individual has to the project. 
As the level increases so does that individuals responsibility accordingly. 

## Onboarding New Members

When new members show interest in being a part of the project, they will be onbaorded and briefed on the project's aims and objectives as well as progress update. 
This will be in the form of an onboarding pack which includes all materials that is needed to succesfully undertsnad the project, as well as a 1:1 chat with the Community Manager who will ensure all information is understood. 


## In person Communications

This will be in the form of online video conferencing to accomodate these in-person events. 

### Meet-ups

Currently we have a fortnightly meet-up where anyone who is interested in the project can participate. 

One key channel in which individuals find out about these meet-ups is through connection with Autistica and thorugh Twitter.
Therefore these are two engagement pathways that will be continnuously active to ensure upkeep and icnrease in participation. 

The aim of the meet-ups is to discuss and work on different areas of the project as well as a space for onboarding. 

### Co-working (TBC) 

### Knowledge Share (TBC) 

These sessions would be to knowledge share on a specific aspect/topic of the project to keep all memebers updated on what is going on int he different branches of the project. 
These could be schedueld in relation to the need of them. 
For example, if the topic has been worked on extensively in both the meet-ups and co-working, and needs a longer slot to update the group, then this can be done.

We cannot build this tool without the input of a diverse community of autistic people and their relatives and carers.
We also welcome open source developers to join us in building it.

**Is there an onboarding process? **

Yes! There are many channels in which you can fidn out about the project. When you first join, whether this is via our social platfomrs such as Twitter or Slack or if you attend one of our meet-ups, the community manager will run through with you key information about the project. The discussion will also help highlight areas where you can contribute due to your interests. 

The current community manager is Lotty Coupat - if you would like to get involved with the project the best thing is to email her at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

**How much time commitment is needed? **

Anyone can contribute to the project as per their availability. Many contributors attend the community meet-ups that occure on every second and fourth Thursday of the month, to either co-work on issues or to provide ideas and feedback. Other contributors regularly collaborate with the project as reviewers and maintainers, by helping other members to contribute to the project.

You can pick up issues whenever you have capacity and we completly understand that capacity changes and there are other priorities (full-time jobs). We welcome all contributions. 

**What is meant by Participatory Research? **

Participatory science is when the people who will ultimately benefit from or be affected most by research are included in empowered positions throughout the research process.
We want autistic voices to be heard at every stage of the research process, so that the tool we build, the community we grow, and the research we do is both by autistic people and for autistic people.
We also warmly welcome the input of people who are not autistic themselves.
You can really make a difference!

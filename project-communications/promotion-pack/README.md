# Promotion Pack - AutSPACEs

This pack should help anyone needing the key information to distribute it to anyone seeking more information about the project. 

## What is the AutSPACEs project? 

Autistic people may have sensory processing sensitivities and differences when compared to non-autistic people. These differences can make it difficult to navigate environments that were not built with sensory processing sensitivities  in mind. For example, for some people it can be stressful to take a busy train during rush hour, or to attend an appointment in a brightly lit hospital waiting room.

Understanding sensory processing differences, and learning what could make environments better for autistic people, are top community priorities. We know this because these questions were two of the top ten questions for autism research in a recent priority setting exercise. To make this list, over 1,000 people were consulted, 75% of whom were autistic. You can find out more about the list and how it was created in Autistica's summary.

In order to really make a difference, we want to take the research out of the lab and learn from the  living experience of autistic people in their daily lives.

We want to gather many autistic people’s stories together. Our goals are to:
1. Share the stories with people who have similar experiences
2. Educate non-autistic people on how they can better support autistic people
3. Advise people on how they can design and adapt spaces to improve autistic people’s lives.

To do these three things and reach as many people as possible, we are building an online tool where they can share their experiences. There are lots of different options for how we design this tool, what features we include, and how we let people know about it. We think autistic people and their families and carers are the best people to ask.


## Who are the community members?

This project is a collaboration between Autistica and The Alan Turing Institute. Autistica is a UK-based charity whose mission is to help autistic people and their families have long, healthy, happy lives. The Alan Turing Institute is the UK's National Institute for artificial intelligence and data science. We have partnered with Open Humans Foundation, who have helped us adapt their file management system for storing the data the tool will collect.
You can find out more about all these organisations on their websites:
Autistica
The Alan Turing Institute
Open Humans Foundation
At the heart of the community are autistic participants, families, carers, volunteers and open source developers. This is an open project, which anyone is invited to contribute to.

### *Explaining Contribution Channels*
#### Key: [Square brackets = image]; "Quotation marks" = spoken voiceover; -text = text which appears on screen

[Researcher or participant is speaking and fully takes up screen – speaker waving]: 

“Hello, my name is (Kirstie?), and I’m going to show you the different ways you can contribute to Autistica and the Turing’s Citizen Science Project”.

“For this project we want to collect together autistic people’s experiences of sensory processing and navigating environments so that we can help improve understanding of autistic people’s lives, and change spaces so that they are better and more inclusive for autistic people, their families and carers”. 

“The project is broken up into different stages." 

[Speaker half screen –1. Design - text]

“In the first stage, we will design an online tool which autistic people can use to share their experiences. 
This is what we mean when we talk about a ‘citizen science platform’ – it is a way of collecting information online from a whole range of people.”

[Speaker half screen still – 2: Gather Data - text]
“Later, when the tool has been built, we will begin to collect experiences about sensory processing and environments”.

[Back to 1.Design text]
“You can join us at the beginning of the project as one of the citizen science platform designers, and help decide what kind of citizen science platform should be built, how it should be built, and what questions it should ask.” 

“Here’s how to do it:”

 “You can find information about the project and steps to taking part on our GitHub repository. 
 You can find it by putting this link into your browser:

[Screen view of navigating to and within GitHub]

“…Or just by googling Autistica Alan Turing Citizen Science Project”

“GitHub is an online website which allows volunteers from anywhere in the world to work together on projects and design code together.” 

“A “repository” is just a place which holds all the code, documents, and comments relating to a project.” 

“You need a GitHub account to use GitHub to contribute, but it’s simple to make and you don’t have to use your real name.”

[scrolling to participant information sheet/zoom]
“The first thing to do before you take part is to read the participant information sheet. 
This has important information about who can take part, how to take part, and what happens to the information you share when you do take part. 
There are lots of different options:”

[navigating google forms survey – including entering info]
“You can give us your ideas about how the citizen science platform should be designed by filling in our Google Forms Survey. 
You can access this on the main GitHub page, and we will also send round a link to the project’s mailing list.“

“The survey asks a very general question, because we want the direction and design to come from you.” 

[These can be typed in while the voice is reading them out]
“You can tell us about anything you think is important. 
This can include needs, for example, “I need the platform to let me share experiences after they have happened, because I might be too stressed to share them at the time”, priorities, for example, “It’s important that the platform is designed in a way that can reach people from across the whole autistic spectrum”, desires, for example, “I want the platform to have the option to upload a photograph”, and concerns, for example, “How can I be sure that my data will be kept safe?”. 

“It also asks you about your personal connection to autism. 
This is to make sure that autistic people and those connected to autism are being represented.”  

“When you are ready, give it a second look to make sure you’re happy, and then submit” 

[Back to speaker]
“We don’t ask you for any other information, or for your name, so everything you tell us will be anonymous, but everything you do say, once it has been checked over, will be made public on GitHub. 
Please don’t put anything in the survey you don’t want to be made public.”

[Raise an Issue - text]

“You can also contribute to the project by raising an issue on GitHub."

[Screen view of issues journey]

"An issue is a public comment on GitHub which suggests something about the project you think should be addressed. 
An example might be that you would like the values statement to be changed because you think it’s missing something. 
You can comment or raise issues by clicking on the issues tab, and then clicking on the button which says “New Issue”." 

"Before deciding to write a new issue, please look at the list of issues which have already been raised, so the same comment isn’t repeated. 
You will then need to choose a title, and write your comment. 
Members of the research team or other participants can comment on what you write, and changes may be made based on your suggestions. 
You can also respond to other people’s issues if you have ideas about how to respond to them." 

[Back to speaker]
[Create a Pull Request - text]

"You can contribute to the project by making a ‘pull request’ on GitHub.
A pull request is when you make changes and ask for them to be accepted. 
This could be a change to the code or to any of the documents." 

"Making a pull request can at first seem quite daunting when you are not used to GitHub, but it is simple to learn and it means you can be actively involved in designing the platform and deciding how the project is managed." 

[Screen view of creating a real pull request – perhaps a comment on one of the project docs]

“When you log in to GitHub and go to the GitHub repository page, you can directly make changes to the project and ask for them to be accepted by the project community and the research team.”

“To do this, first respond to an issue on GitHub, or write a new issue explaining what you are doing. 
Then “fork” the AutisticaCitizenScience repository to your profile. 
Forking the repository just means that you will have a copy of your own which you can make changes to. 
You can then ask for those changes to be made to the main repository by creating a “pull request”."

“When you have made the changes you want to make and are ready to submit a pull request, please add the following information to the contents of the pull request message:
  * Describe the problem you're trying to fix in the pull request, reference any related issue and use fixes/close to automatically close them, if they are related to the changes you are making.
  * List any changes proposed in the pull request.
  * Describe what the reviewer should concentrate their feedback on.”
  
“If you have opened the pull request early and know that its contents are not ready for review or to be merged (added to the main project), add [WIP] at the start of the pull request title, which stands for "Work in Progress". 
When you are happy with it and are happy for it to be merged into the main repository, change the [WIP] in the title of the pull request to [Ready for review].”

[Back to speaker]

“A member of the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science team will then review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main repository. 
A review will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done. 
Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.”
More information on how to contribute using GitHub can be found on the Contributing to the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science document on GitHub.” 

[Attend an In-Person Session - text]

“There will also be opportunities to attend sessions relating to the project in-person. 
These include focus groups where you will be asked about your thoughts on the project, and user testing sessions where we will show you possibilities for the platform and you can tell us what you think. 
Focus groups will be in-person, and user testing sessions will be either in-person or more likely will use an online video calling system like Skype or Zoom. 
All of these sessions are paid in line with involve guidelines, and we have lots of information on what we do with the feedback you give us, which you can read about on our GitHub repository.” 

“One way to be involved is to sign up to Autistica’s Discover network, which we recruit from.”

“There is a simple sign-up process. 
You will be asked some questions about who you are and your relationship to autism. 
This is to make sure that a range of people are being represented in the project. 
Once you sign up, emails will be sent to you with opportunities for involvement, which you can reply to if you would like to take part.”

“Unfortunately, because resources are limited, not everybody will be able to take part this way. 
Those who are invited to take part will receive further instructions including the venue location and more information about what to expect from the session. 
We do try to make sure that we have a mixture of autistic people, and the relatives and carers of autistic people, as well as trying to make sure that we represent a diverse group.”

“We understand that it might be difficult for some people attend, and it’s important the project is inclusive, which is why we have lots of different options for taking part. 
If you have any concerns or suggestions, you can enter them into the Google Forms Survey, or you can raise an issue or comment on GitHub. 
You can also email members of the research team. 
We are open to making changes based on your suggestions. 
We want it to be as easy as possible for you to take part.”

[Making your Contribution Public - text]

[Screen view journey of contributors.md file]

 “If you want the world to know about the great work you’ve been doing, you can also email one of the researchers to have your contribution made public. 
 You can choose to use your own name or if you don’t want that made public, you can decide on a different name. 
 We will put the name you choose along with the type of contributions you’ve made (with a matching emoji) on our contributors.md file”

“Finally, you get be in touch by signing up to our mailing list to receive project updates and opportunities, or by emailing the researchers. 
Thank you for watching! We hope you choose to take part.”

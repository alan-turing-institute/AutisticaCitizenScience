## Contributor Spotlight

Today we are spotlighting on Anoushka Ramesh who has been a key contributor to the AutSPACEs platform development! 

**Tell us a little about yourself...**

Hi everyone! 
Iâ€™m Anoushka Ramesh, a Computer Science undergraduate from India and an active contributor to AutSPACEs. 
Interestingly enough, my love for Computer Science really grew during the pandemic where I first started delving into mini projects related to frontend technologies like HTML, CSS and slowly made my way to learning APIs and other tools like Python, React and Django. 
The open source path looked like a perfect opportunity to apply my new found knowledge for a good cause. AutSPACEs caught my eye as I was going through the list of INCF open source projects for the Google Summer of Code program. 
It sounded like a wonderful project that aimed to dig deep into understanding the experiences of autistic people and what causes environments to be better or worse for autistic people.
So, now it has been almost a month of contributing to AutSPACEs and it has been nothing short of exciting to say the least!

**What are your favourite hobbies/things to do:**

My university has an active computer science club called [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/) where I contribute to interesting projects and learn new skills. 
Infact, this is where I got introduced to the concept of open source and contributing to organizations. 
I also like writing blogs and coming up with social media content for the club. 
Apart from club activities, I love singing, dancing, reading (Agatha Christieâ€™s novels are a personal favourite), baking and public speaking.   

**What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?**

Currently, Iâ€™ve been collaborating with the AutSPACEs community and the platform developers to understand the immediate needs and requirements of the site. 
Iâ€™ve worked on building the landing page and the share experiences page as part of the Milestone 2 issues. 
I have also helped other contributors with any problems or issues theyâ€™ve faced while building the site locally or understanding the code base. 
Weâ€™ll almost be completing Milestone 2 and weâ€™re looking forward to working on Milestone 3!

**Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:**

One helpful tip to follow while contributing is to â€˜commit and communicateâ€™. 
Commit your work to the repository as often as you can and ensure that you communicate to your project mentors or lead developers on the team regarding those work updates. 
This essentially serves two purposes:-
- Your mentors/lead devs are aware of the progress youâ€™re making
- You can make use of the opportunity to ask any doubts or queries that you may have in addition to giving your updates

Keep in mind that project heads are very busy people so itâ€™s always best to plan and ask them in advance regarding any meetings that you would like to have. 
Considering their hectic time schedules, it would also be better to try addressing the code issues yourself first before approaching the project leads. 
Google comes in really handy to address almost any problem you may have in mind. 
So, the next time youâ€™re stuck on an issue, always remember to Google it!


## Project Information

### Keep udpated via our Social Media Platforms!

**TWITTER** - AutSPACEs has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AutSpaces)!
Please go and give us a follow!

If you are social media savvy we would love to hear from you and get input into running the account, sharing it, and using it to promote the platform.

**SLACK** - We also use Slack as a communication channel to advertise to our community our latest events and project progress and any opportunities for wider persepctives and comments. 
This is a key area to discuss project work with other contributors!

To join the Slack channel you will firstly need to go through [Open Humans Slack](https://slackin.openhumans.org/) and set up an account and once that's done then follow this [link](https://openhumans.slack.com/archives/CNMECPNCD) to our channel. 

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas.
Is it really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 
We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Lotty at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! 

## Project Opportunities

We currently are looking for opportunities to spread the word of the project to increase paricipation. 

If you have any ideas for this, we would love to know, please send your ideas via email to [Lotty](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).
This could be anything from talks with charities/univeristies or posts in various communications channels that you are a part of. 
Please share any information with any individuals who you think would be interested in joining and contributing to the project.

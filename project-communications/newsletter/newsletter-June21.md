# Newsletter - June 2021

**Hi everyone!!**

Firstly, thank you for opening and reading this month's newsletter ðŸ˜„ We are so happy you are here!

June is showing us some warmer weather that I really hope is raising spirits! 

There is a lot of change happening right now with the COVID roadmap having come out a couple of months ago and things starting to open up. 
If anyone is struggling with these challenging times, we hope that the citizen science community can offer your support and connection.

Email [Lotty](mailto:ccoupat@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if we can help you with involvement, and do feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us.

They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Best wishes for everyone! ðŸ’®

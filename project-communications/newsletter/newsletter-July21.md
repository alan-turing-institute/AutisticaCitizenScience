# Newsletter - July 2021

**Hi everyone!!**

Firstly, thank you for opening and reading this month's newsletter ðŸ˜„ We are so happy you are here!

June is showing us some warmer weather that I really hope is raising spirits! 

There is a lot of change happening right now with the COVID roadmap having come out a couple of months ago and things starting to open up. 
If anyone is struggling with these challenging times, we hope that the citizen science community can offer your support and connection.

Email [Lotty](mailto:ccoupat@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if we can help you with involvement, and do feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us.

## Project Information

### Keep udpated via our Social Media Platforms!

**TWITTER** - AutSPACEs has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AutSpaces)!
Please go and give us a follow!

If you are social media savvy we would love to hear from you and get input into running the account, sharing it, and using it to promote the platform.

**SLACK** - We also use Slack as a communication channel to advertise to our community our latest events and project progress and any opportunities for wider persepctives and comments. 
This is a key area to discuss project work with other contributors!

To join the Slack channel you will firstly need to go through [Open Humans Slack](https://slackin.openhumans.org/) and set up an account and once that's done then follow this [link](https://openhumans.slack.com/archives/CNMECPNCD) to our channel. 

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas.
Is it really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 
We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Lotty at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! 


## Project Opportunities

### Spreading the word

We currently are looking for opportunities to spread the word of the project to increase paricipation.

This could be anything from talks with charities/univeristies or posts in various communications channels that you are a part of. 
Please share any information with any individuals who you think would be interested in joining and contributing to the project.

### Opportunities for contribution

There are lots of areas, as defined above, where you can get involved in the project. 
If you are not too sure where to get started here are a few beginner issues which are a great place to start:

### Get involved

Following the first meet-up group session on Thursday 25th January, a number of areas crucial to the project were identified in which people were interested in helping out:

   *  Research
   *  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
   *  Platform development
   *  Accessibility and Inclusion 
   *  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

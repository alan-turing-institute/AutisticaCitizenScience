# December Newsletter 2022

Hi everyone! Seasons greetings! Hope you've been enjoying the snow (if you're UK-based) and it's not caused too many problems for you! It's been a while since our last newsletter because we were on pause while our new team started and while Kirstie was on maternity leave. We'll be starting up regular newsletters and meet-up sessions again in January 2023, and we've got lots we're excited to share with you and to show you. So we wanted to send you lots of festive good cheer before the winter break and invite you to our first meet-up session of 2023: 


| Date | Time | Location |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Thursday 12th March | 13:00-14:00 | Online via. Zoom: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/92231923469?pwd=TXFCNFZISzJjajFoaUpIOG1MTURKdz09 |


Professor Jonathan Green will be visiting The Alan Turing Institute on the 12th January and will be joining us for the meet-up session on zoom. Jonathan has long-standing professonial and clinical expertise in autism and is currently working on a "phenomenology of autism" based on the lived experinces of people with autism.  

Email [Sophia](mailto:sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk) or [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if you want to get involveed or don't know where to start, and feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us.

## Project News

With almost a year's worth of update's there's far too much to include in one newsletter, so here are some of the highlights: 

### New AutSPACEs team!

We're delghted to welcome fantastic new members to the AutSPACEs team. Community manager Sophia Batchelor and researcher Georgia Aitkenhead will be joined by two members of The Turing's Research Engineerng Group: Callum Mole and Helen Duncan. Callum and Helen will be working on platform development, helping to put all of your amazing ideas into action and making sure that we have a fully functional platform that is accessible and easy to use. We have also been joined by the wonderful Bastian Greshake Tzovaras who is the new project lead for AutSPACEs. You can find out more about Bastian in our contributor spotlight interview, below. 

We're all looking forward to sharing our work and passion with the AutSPACEs community and learning from you all! 

### Platform 

We have been in the process of implementing the amazing platform designs created by Sophia and Soledad, based on gathering and analysing commmunity feedback. The result is an inclusive design founded on the preferences and feedback of autistic AutSPACEs community members. Thanks especally to Otis and Sue for your thoughts and feedback on the design! 

You can see design work as well as steps taken to create the design in the platform design folder of our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/wireframes/platform-prototype-21-02-2022.md. We are working on the platform development via. issus and pull requests on GitHub: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs. 

We're excited to do some more user testing and keep improving the platform in 2023. 

### Moderation 

Susanna and James have continued to lead on the moderation strategies for the AutSPACEs platform, which is a hugely impressive feat! Enormous thanks to them for their skills, insights, and efforts. We now have a code of conduct, moderation guidelines, and guidelines for suppporting others to be heard. We have also developed a unique "traffic lights" system to address potentially triggering content while allowing for individual self-experession. These strategies and resources come from a series of challenging conversations on the topic of moderation which many of you were a part of. Many thanks to all of you who were involved in bringing to light the nuances of this complex issue. 

### Presentations

We've been working hard to advocate for open and participatory research practices and share our view of the importance of research by and for the people for whom there is most at stake. Here's a selection of some of the talks we've given: 

* The Turing Way Fireside chat: James, Bastian and Georgia spoke to citizen scientsts from MammalWeb and NASA. You can watch the recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaPydydUcOc&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl&index=10).
* "Participatory Science & Co-Creation: AutSPACEs' approach to participatory research", presented by Georgia Aitkenhead and Sophia Batchelor for an AIM RSF Cross-Consortia Knowledge Share Session. Slides available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7113771).
* "AutSPACEs: co-creating a citizen science platform", presentation delivered by Georgia Aitkenhead and James Scott to the UK Centre for Data Ethics anad Innovation. Slides available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6411932)
* 'Citizen Science with AutSPACEs': workshop delivered by Georgia Aitkenhead, Sophia Batchelor, James Scott and Susanna Fantoni for the 2022 Mozilla Festival. Slides available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6337903).

## December Contributor Spotlight - Bastian Greshake Tzovaras

Today we are spotlighting Bastian Greshake Tzovaras who has just joined the Turing Institute as Senior Researcher for Participatory Citizen Science and who will support AutSPACEs moving forward.

### Tell us a little about yourself...
In a former life I used to be a biologist with a focus on bioinformatics and evolutionary biology (my PhD was on the genomes of lichens – those fascinating symbiotic organisms consisting of green algae and fungi). But I've always been interested in open science and citizen science and since finishing my PhD I've worked at that intersection to facilitate different citizen science efforts through open source software! 

Since 2017 I have worked at and with the [Open Humans Foundation](https://www.openhumans.org) on building digital infrastructures for the responsible and ethical collection and use of personal data. And before joining the Turing I was a group leader in Paris at Inserm (the French National Institutes of Health), where my group did research on how online platforms can be co-designed and used to facilitate grassroots citizen science projects. My citizen science work so far has mostly been in the space of health, covering topics including chronic fatigue syndrome, [transgender health](https://transbiome.org) and [COVID](https://quantifiedflu.org). 

### What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
Even outside of work I'm interested in doing research, in particular *personal science* or *self-research*, that means visualising and analysing my own data to [learn about myself](https://tzovar.as/quantifiedself/). The other thing I got into quite deeply a hobby in recent years is oldschool analog photography. I develop the film I shoot myself at home and do traditional chemical wet-printing. In Paris I regularly converted the bathroom into a makeshift darkroom for that and I can't wait to do that again now in London!

### What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
A little bit of everything really. I've been contributing to and following AutSPACEs since 2019 already and worked on a first prototype with Georgia back then! Beyond technical contributions I'm also helping in writing up research articles, project management, doing some community engagement and really whatever else needs someone to help out!

### Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
I know myself that it can feel very overwhelming to be "the newcomer" to a group of people that have been working together or just knowing each other already for a while. But most open source projects like AutSPACEs – and really most social efforts that try to do something for the greater good – are always happy to see new faces and equally happy to help out people that have just joined and help getting them settled in. That's why my number tip for contributing to any project really is to just reach out to one or a few of the people that are already involved in a project you want to contribute to. Even in the best-documented projects the personal component is invaluable, as they can help you find your way – plus it can be a lot more fun working _with_ other people than just contributing alone. 


## Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. 
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

Last year, we identified the following areas where we need your help:

* Communication, Engagement and Promotion
* Platform development
* Accessibility and Inclusion
* Moderation

We'll talk again about the different areas and routes to involvement in our meet-up session on the 12th January, so please do join in so we can **make AutSPACEs work for you**.

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs
If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. 
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!

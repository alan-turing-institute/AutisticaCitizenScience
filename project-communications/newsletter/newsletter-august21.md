## Contributor Spotlight

Today we are spotlighting on Robin Taylor who has been a key contributor to the AutSPACEs platform development work! 

**Tell us a little about yourself...**

Iâ€™m Robin Taylor. 
I studied mathematics and operational research at university and then spent most of my working life in insurance and risk management. 
I was made redundant a few years ago which led to early retirement. 
Just before then I had been approached in a pub and asked to become Treasurer of the Pagan Federation, which led to becoming President until I stepped down last year. 
We are an entirely volunteer organisation and I am still extensively involved, while in the process of handing over most of my responsibilities.

One of my adult children has a diagnosis of autism. 
I have come to realise that I share some of the characteristics without having sought or needed a formal diagnosis. 
While admitting the difficulties in diagnosing dead people, there is certainly evidence of autism in my family history on my fatherâ€™s side.

**What are your favourite hobbies/things to do:**

Iâ€™ve always been interested in too many things. 
I have been bringing to life again my interest in mathematics and computer science, which had been buried under the demands of working life. 
There is a part of me that is interested in decolonial anthropology as a way of seeing what may be possible in changing the world for the better. 
I also enjoy going for long walks, looking at wildlife and archaeology, and taking photographs.

**What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?**

Iâ€™m currently working on platform development, which has provided impetus for a long standing project to learn Django.
I sometimes contribute to moderation discussions where my experience from a volunteer organisation with a social media presence can be useful.

**Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:**

Relax and appreciate that this is a participatory project for neurodiverse people, and what you say will not be used against you.

Discussions about autism are much more interesting and useful if the majority of those in the room are either autistic or open to the possibility that they might be so. 
There is then much less need to fight off labels, projections, and assumptions about a lack of empathy and imagination. 
With the lack of stigma an honest discussion can take place. 
One of the most significant discussions of my life was in a social context with someone who had also been a mathematics student. 
We were reflecting on our past experiences in groups of people with significant unacknowledged autism. 
We became open to the possibility that we ourselves were to some extent autistic, evidenced by remembering learning social skills a few years later than our contemporaries.

## Project Opportunities

### Spreading the word

We currently are looking for opportunities to spread the word of the project to increase paricipation. 

If you have any ideas for this, we would love to know, please send your ideas via email to [Lotty](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).
This could be anything from talks with charities/univeristies or posts in various communications channels that you are a part of. 
Please share any information with any individuals who you think would be interested in joining and contributing to the project.

### Opportunities for contribution

There are lots of areas, as defined above, where you can get involved in the project. 
If you are not too sure where to get started here are a few beginner issues which are a great place to start:

**"Collate content for the platform's About page."** [Issue #529](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/529)

**"Add accessibility requirements as checklist."** [Issue #522](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/522)

**"Create a promotion pack for AutSPACEs project."**[Issue #516](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/516)

If any of these issues seem interesting, please comment on this issue if you have a GitHub account. 
If you don't have an account no worries! 
Simply send [Lotty](mailto:ccoupat@turing.ac.uk) letting her know that you would like to contribute. 

## Project Information

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas.
Is it really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 
We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Lotty at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!

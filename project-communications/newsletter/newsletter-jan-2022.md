# January Newsletter

Hi everyone!!

Thank you for opening and reading January's newsletter. We are so happy you are here! Hope you had a wonderful festive break and enjoyable new year celebrations. For everybody celebrating the Chinese New Year tomorrow, wishing you luck, happiness, and health! The first month of 2022 has passed pretty quickly, with lots happening for AutSPACEs, although many of us have been battling January colds and covid. There have been some lovely, bright sunny days here in London. As ever, wherever you are and however you are, the AutSPACEs community is here to offer you support and connection.

Email Georgia to let us know if we can help you with involvement, and do feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us. They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Best wishes for everyone!

## Project News

The most recent updates on the project and its progress can be found here.

Meet-ups are being held every 2nd and 4th Thursday of the month, as well as the Platform Development co-working sessions on every 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month. Everyone is welcome to join! The best way to continue contributing is either through these events or by joining our Slack channel via Open Humans and heading to the #autistica-turing channel.
New community manager positions at The Turing

The model of participatory, open science is being extended at The Turing thanks to a successful bid by PI Kirstie Whitaker, with funding for two new projects looking at AI for multiple-long term conditions, and for developing citizen science more broadly. This research will draw from the learnings of AutSPACEs, and the teams will connect with the AutSPACEs community.

### We are currently looking for two community managers, and you can find out more here.

Closing dates are 2nd February, and 13th February, at midnight. Interviews will be held later in February, and the panel will include an AutSPACEs community member.

### Successful MozFest bid
Sophia and Georgia were accepted to present on AutSPACEs at MozFest 2022, a festival of open science. The festival will be held online in March. We are looking for autistic collaborators to co-present, so if you have made a contribution to AutSPACEs and would like to be involved, let us know by emailing Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

### Design work for the AutSPACEs platform
Soledad and Sophia have now created designs for many of the AutSPACEs platform pages. The designs are based on the rainbow infinity symbol for neurodiversity as well as recommendations and feedback from the community. The designs were presented at a recent meet up session and new comments and feedback are being incorporated.

### Progress on moderation
Susanna and James have been making more progress on moderation for the AutSPACEs platform and have been thinking carefully about how to write guidelines for making posts about others. We want autistic people to make rules and guidance so that everyone's posts are respectful and useful. You are all invited to get involved via our Issues and Pull Requests on GitHub. Take a look at the Moderation Milestone to find out more. You can also join a meet up session to join in the co-creation of the guidelines.

### Method Paper Draft complete
We've completed a paper on recommendations for combining participatory research, open source, and citizen science, which is now being reviewed by the authors.

Anyone is invited to join in the user research, design or moderation work by taking part in our development sessions on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of the month, or our meet-up sessions on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays.

## Project Opportunities
### Opportunities for contribution

There are lots of areas, as defined above, where you can get involved in the project.

If you are not too sure where to get started, here are a few beginner issues you might want to look at:

"Link to other organisations." Issue #590
"Collate content for the platform's About page." Issue #529
"Collect impact stories for the AutSPACEs project." Issue #548

All other issues for the project can be found in our repository. If any of these issues seem interesting, please comment on the issue if you have a GitHub account. If you don't have an account, no worries! Simply send Georgia an email letting her know that you would like to contribute.

## January Contributor Spotlight - Soledad Li

Today we are spotlighting on Soledad Li who has been a key contributor to the AutSPACEs via meet-ups, design work, and code.

    Tell us a little about yourself...

    Hi everyone. I am Xiaojing Li from China and you can call me Soledad. I am an M2 Digital Sciences student from The University of Paris, and am currently doing my internship in web development at AutSPACEs.
    What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?

    I love visiting vegetable markets and cooking in my free time. Food is my energy source. I love experimenting with new dishes and sharing dishes out with my family and my friends. Apart from that, I like curating and building art projects with my friends together.
    What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?

    I have been working on the design, user research and the frontend development of AutSPACEs. Apart from that, I get the chance to host the meet-up every other two weeks. With support from Sophia, I got to build a set of user personas and user matrices to understand the user needs for AutSPACEs and identify key features of the platform. I am currently working on the frontend code part, like refactoring codes, and building templates for future contributors to use. I have learned a lot from this process and am super exicted to see the final results.
    Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:

    I think the best tip for contributing is to be brave and take the initiative! When I first joined the AutSPACEs project, I was always afraid to mess up work or to create some unnecessary trouble, and did not participate so much. Later, Kirstie assured me that there was no need to worry, and encouraged me to find tasks on my own. With her support and encouragement, I got to contribute more to the project, as well as improving my skills in communication, design, and programming. I think this advice is one of the best tips I have received, and I'd love to share it with others as well!

## Project Information
### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

    Communication, Engagement and Promotion
    Platform development
    Accessibility and Inclusion
    Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or suggest another working group, please email Georgia. If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the Project and for Platform Development. If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved.

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, The Turing Way Book has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!

Very best wishes,

Soledad, Kirstie and Georgia

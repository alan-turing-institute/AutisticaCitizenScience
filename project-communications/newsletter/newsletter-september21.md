## Project Opportunities

### Spreading the word

We currently are looking for opportunities to spread the word of the project to increase paricipation. 

If you have any ideas for this, we would love to know, please send your ideas via email to [Lotty](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).
This could be anything from talks with charities/univeristies or posts in various communications channels that you are a part of. 
Please share any information with any individuals who you think would be interested in joining and contributing to the project.

### Opportunities for contribution

There are lots of areas, as defined above, where you can get involved in the project. 
If you are not too sure where to get started here are a few beginner issues which are a great place to start:

**"Collate content for the platform's About page."** [Issue #529](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/529)

**"Create a promotion pack for AutSPACEs project."**[Issue #516](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/516)

All other issues for the project can be found in [our repository(https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues).

If any of these issues seem interesting, please comment on this issue if you have a GitHub account. 

If you don't have an account no worries! 
Simply send [Lotty](mailto:ccoupat@turing.ac.uk) letting her know that you would like to contribute. 

## Project Information

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas.
Is it really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 
We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Lotty at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!

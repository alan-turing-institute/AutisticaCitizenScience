## About this project (videos and presentations)

## Friends, supporters, and partners

* [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/): The Alan Turing Institute is funded by Autistica to deliver the Autistica/Turing citizen science project and the platform AutSPACEs. 
It is the UK's national institute for data science and AI innovation. 
* [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/): Autistica is a UK autism research charity which supports autistic people by funding research, shaping policy and working with autistic people to understand their needs. Autistica upports and funds the Autistica/Turing citizen science project.
* [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/): Opeen Humans is an international not-for-profit organisation, dedicated to empowering individuals and communities around their personal data, to explore and share for the purposes of education, health, and research. They are providing the backend infrastructure and data management system for AutSPACEs. 
* [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome): The Turing Way is an open source, community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science. You can become part of their community, and contribute to the guide, by visiting their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)
* [Open Life Sciences](https://openlifesci.org/): The Open Life Science (OLS) program helps individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors. The Autistica/Turing citizen science project was part the second cohort.

### Autism: recommended books

Happé, F., & Fletcher-Watson, S. (2019). **Autism: A New Introduction to Psychological Theory and Current Debate.** This is a fantastic introduction into autism for anyone wanting to join the project who is unfaamiliar with current autism research and points of discussion. It is highly value-aligned with this project.

BMC Medical Ethics, 18(1), 4. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9: this is an academic paper which looks at the conditions which give people genuine agency over data used for medical research. It's great for laying out clearly a raange of reaasons to adopt dynamic consent (in which paarticipants of reseaarch studies are able to easily change their consent.)

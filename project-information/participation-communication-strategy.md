# Participation and Communication Strategy

This is where you will find all information and strategic direction of our communicaion and engagement to ensure participation on the AutSPACEs Project. 

## Mountain of Engagement

Our Mountain of Engagement can be seem in the below image. 

It shows the levels of engagement and paritcipation that there is within the Project. 
It is important to note that there is not a hierarchy in realtion to how important you are to the project. 
Each level is crucial and essential to the success of the project. 

The MoE allows us to map out where contributors lie and where we can provide opportunities to allow individuals to increase their participation to the next level. 
A key difference between each level in the responsibility the individual has to the project. 
As the level increases so does that individuals responsibility accordingly. 

## Onboarding New Members

When new members show interest in being a part of the project, they will be onbaorded and briefed on the project's aims and objectives as well as progress update. 
This will be in the form of an onboarding pack which includes all materials that is needed to succesfully undertsnad the project, as well as a 1:1 chat with the Community Manager who will ensure all information is understood. 


## In person Communications

This will be in the form of online video conferencing to accomodate these in-person events. 

### Meet-ups

Currently we have a fortnightly meet-up where anyone who is interested in the project can participate. 

One key channel in which individuals find out about these meet-ups is through connection with Autistica and thorugh Twitter.
Therefore these are two engagement pathways that will be continnuously active to ensure upkeep and icnrease in participation. 

The aim of the meet-ups is to discuss and work on different areas of the project as well as a space for onboarding. 

### Co-working (TBC) 

The aim of these sessions would be for 

### Knowledge Share (TBC) 

These sessions would be to knowledge share on a specific aspect/topic of the project to keep all memebers updated on what is going on int he different branches of the project. 
These could be schedueld in relation to the need of them. 
For example, if the topic has been worked on extensively in both the meet-ups and co-working, and needs a longer slot to update the group, then this can be done. 

## Online Communications

The aim of online communications is to keep contributors engaged in the periods between project (in-person) sessions. 

### Newsletter

Every month, a newsletter will be distributed to those subscribed to it.
It inlcudes project updates as well as any information, resources or opportunities associated with AutSPACEs. 
It will also include nformation about the upcoming events as part of the project. 

### Slack Channel

We will use Slack as a way to keep regular contact with the members and contributors both in a formal and informal manner. 
It will be set up with multiple channels where contributors can ask questions about any related topic. 
It will also allow for questions that are out of scope, and therefore not part of discussions in project specific events, to be discussed and evaluated with contributors. 
Slack will be a new platform for many individuals, and therefore it will be crucial to ensure that new members and contribtuors know how to use this platform. 
This will be engrained in the onboarding process. 

### Twitter

Our twitter platform will also be a way to regularly inform followers of our progress and keep in touch with our contributors. 
But it will also be a key way to increase our participation by promoting and spreading the word of the project to increase contributors and members. 

### Intergration with Autistica and Open Humans

We will ensure that there the project has continuous connections between Autistica, Open Humans and the Alan Turing Institute.
This can be in the form of talks and presentations as well including them in all our communciations. 
Throughout the project we will continously seek out opportunities to integrate these communitities. 

### Progress Report (TBC) 

The progress report will be key in informing participants of updates on the project. 
It will include key information such as:
- Number of Issues raised and closed
- Number of Pull Requests raised and closed 
- Community updates
- Software Development Updates
- Project Management Update
- Tasks Completed this week
- Upcoming tasks for next week

This will be created and uploaded on our GitHub on a fortnightly basis. 
It will also be included/linked to in our newsletter and presented as an agenda piece in our meet-ups.

### Pre-engagement

The aim of these communications will be to specifically advertise up-coming events/meetings. 

They will be used to inform of the topics that will be discussed as well as allowing for topics to be proposed. This could be via a HackMD/Google doc to also allow people to "sign up" so that we have an idea of who is coming to the meeting. 

Links to the meeting and calendar invites will be included.

Link to previous meeting summary will also be available with a small explanation of what was discussed. 

### Post-engagement

The aim of these communications will be to capture what happened in the meeting that has occured. 

This will include a link to the most recent summary of the meeting, in which those that attended can be reminded of what happened and those who did not attend can catch up.

# Accessibility Checklist

This file lists criteria for accesibility according to gov.uk. 
While we will create more rigorous and specific standards of accessibility and customisation for our project outputs in relation to autism, this provides a thoroughly tested bar for inclusion across multiple dimensions. 
Please use this document to check any online project outputs for accessibility.

## Want to tell us something?

If you want to tell us something, the best way is to fill in our [online form](https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm).
This is just a box where you can tell us anything which matters to you about the project.
There really are no limits!

For example, you could write in the box:

* An idea for the tool we make
* Something you like
* Something you don't like
* A concern
* A suggested improvement
* Something you want the project to help with
* Anything else!

What you write in the box will be published on this site, but we will take out information which might make you identifiable first.

You can see what other community members have written in the [community recommendations folder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations).

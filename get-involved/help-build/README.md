## Help build the platform

We are currently developing our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the platform. 

_A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development._

If you do have coding skills or are looking to learn some, you can help by addressing issues, reviewing pull requests, and answering questions on the project's [Platform Development GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs).

If you don't currently have coding experience, we will most definitely need your help in the future for testing the product and it's design.
Please keep an eye out in the future for any information on this if you are interested. 

To understand how the project will look, the [platform designs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs) folder contains lots of key documentation on this and is a great place to start.

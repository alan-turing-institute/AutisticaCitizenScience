### [Moderation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/Moderation)

Here you will find all the work that has been carried out on the Moderation workstream of the project.

Moderation looks into how we can keep the platform safe and appropriate for public viewers. This includes decisions on:
- What is an appropriate or inappropriate story
- How the platform will facilitate moderating stories
- Who will moderate stories and what the process is 
- Define the escalation route if moderators are unsure 
- Define the interaction between users and moderators

### [Pull Request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pulls)

If you want to make changes or add content to our repository in GitHub, you will see that you have to save the work to a branch. This is because we need to review the additions before

Once you have created a contribution in a branch, the best way to get this merged into our documentation is to make a pull request. 

A pull request will let us know about the changes you want to make to the GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, members of the project team can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

If you would like to know more about GitHub, the Turing Way has a great guide on how to use it's features and why it is a great resource for Open Source projects. You can find the guides [here](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html).

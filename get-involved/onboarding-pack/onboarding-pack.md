# AutSPACEs Onboarding Pack

The onboarding pack should provide you with all the information you need to start on the project. 

If you would like to join contribute to the project, please contact our community manager [Lotty Coupat](mailto:ccoupat@turing.ac.uk) who will run through this pack with you and discuss areas you can get involved in. 

Alternatively, you can turn up to on of our community meet ups which occure on evey 2nd and 4th Thursday of every month.

# Lotty Coupat - Community Manager Objectives

Lotty is on secondment to the Alan Turing Institute over from the Civil Service for six months.
Below are the objestives for Lotty's posting as the Community Manager of the AutSPACEs project. 

## 1) Improving the trend of raised and closed issues that are integral to the running of the AutSPACEs project through connecting with key stakeholders to ensure the reviewing process is carried out. 

**Measure of success:**
- Increased numbers of opened issues over the secondment
- Increased numbers of closed issues over the secondment
- Increased numbers of different people credited as contributing to the work of closed issues

I will see that issues and pull requests are reviewed on time through ensuring good communication between contributors/action owners and reviewers. 
I will establish a way to manage and prioritise the issues and pull requests following the overall ambitions and strategic direction of the project and ensure all stakeholder agree and are aware of all updates.  

To do this I will ensure the wide range of stakeholder needs are considered when communicating through the creation and use of various materials. I will identify risks and solutions wherever possible to ensure a reduced number of issues being raised.

For this to be successful, I will have to be build key relationships and a network to ensure the communication between the contributor and review is successful in resolving issues and pull requests. 
I will create an inclusive environment where any individual can raise ideas and thoughts to wide range of contributors for consideration. 
The environment will also allow for continuous feedback mechanisms to ensure the management of the issues and pull requests reflect the strategic direction.  

The success of this objective will be through the increase ratio between the number of issues raised and number of issues closed. 
As, through this, it will show the success of the communication channels as well as management methodology. 

**Civil Service Behaviours:**
- Delivering at Pace 
- Managing a Quality Service
- Working Together

**Leadership Statement – Confident**

I will actively reach out to stakeholders and communicate my asks to ensure that we stay on track with our issues and pull requests for the project. 
I will work effectively work as a team to ensure we resolve issues and that the correct reviewers are involved.  

## 2) Increase participation to the project through establishing key pathways for participation on the AutSPACEs project to ensure the project moves forward in its strategic direction. 

**Measure of success:**
- Feedback during a focus group session with 5 new autistic contributors that they understand how they can contribute to the programme through information contained in the project’s GitHub repository. 
- Feedback during 1:1 30 minute interviews with 5 members of stakeholder organisations (Autistica, Open Humans, Alan Turing Institute) that the onboarding pathways accurately represent the project, its current progress and future goals.

I will create documents that will successfully onboard contributors to the project using a wide range of tools to ensure all accessibility and user requirements are covered. 
I will also improve the Github repository to ensure that all contributors, regardless of technical abilities, can collaborate on the repository as well as ensuring the correct training on using this platform. 
This will ensure I remove any technical barriers in place to enable successful contributions to the project. 
Regular review processes of these documents will be carried out with the users of them to ensure they are up to date and relevant. 

I will be receptive to all new ideas and work closely with participants to ensure ideas are developed and combined into the project. 
The success of this will ensure I create an inclusive and open environment. 

To keep the momentum of participation, I will provide opportunity for all new members to exceed their responsibilities where they feel comfortable to do so. 
To do this I will follow the mountain of engagement methodology to plan and create the channels to enable participants to increase their engagement with the project. 

The success of this objective will be seen through the increase of pull requests from all stakeholder groups of the project as this will show that contributors from all communities of the project are getting involved. 
It will also show the success of the training and documentation. 

**Civil Service Behaviours:**

- Communicating and Influencing 
- Working Together
- Leadership

**Leadership Statement – Empowering**

I will provide a space where contributors can strive to do their best in the project through helping them carry out their actions and provide them with opportunities to help them develop. I will create and inclusive environment to ensure all individuals feel safe to contribute. 

## 3) Integrate the communities that are associated with the AutSPACEs project to increase participation and widespread knowledge of the project

**Measure of success:**
- Increased number of subscribers to the AutSPACEs newsletter.
- Increased number of followers and engagements with the AutSPACEs twitter account.

I will increase the use of various platforms to reach out to the involved communities that are associated and a part of the AutSPACEs project. 
This includes the increase use of Twitter and more structured and regular Newsletter to increase engagement and participation in our project activities.  

I will find new ways to create communications and keep a log of these so that others can learn from my experience using different communications. 

I will listen to the views and ideas from all communities to feed into the organisation and management of activities that will bring the communities together. 
This includes what type of communication they need and how often to ensure adoption and engagement. 
To ensure this happens, I will create safe spaces for voices to be heard and ideas to be discussed and evaluated. 

To ensure that we are successfully integrating communities, and therefore success of this objective, a survey will be distributed to participants with key questions about the project and its communities at regular intervals throughout my posting. 
If the increase understanding of project, its associated communities and their roles in the project is evident, then this objective can be deemed successful. 

**Civil Service Behaviours:**
- Communicating and Influencing
- Working Together
- Leadership

**Leadership Statement – Inspiring**

I will show passion and pride for the project to create a positive and motivated environment to ensure we successfully work as a team to reach our shared vision. 
I will communicate the projects work with clarity, confidence and enthusiasm to influence contributors to have the drive to deliver the project.  

## 4) Internships provide the AutSPACEs project with key skills to ensure development of the platform. I will mentor, guide and manage their tasks and activity to ensure we work as a team to achieve the goals and milestones of the project.  

**Measures of success**
- Successful submission of internship project reports for both interns.
- Positive qualitative 360 review by collaborators across AutSPACEs including my activity manager and the interns themselves.

There are two interns working on the AutSPACEs project during my secondment. 
One a data science masters student and one an undergraduate student in computers science participating as a member of the Google Summer of Code. 
Under the supervision of my activity manager at the Turing Institute (Dr Kirstie Whitaker) I will manage and mentor the interns to successful completion of their projects. 

I will work collaboratively with each intern to understand their skills, activities and ambitions to then find the best opportunities for them in the project. 
I will identify where their skills lie and fit into the strategic direction of the project as this will be integral to the success of the project. 
I will need to understand areas of work beyond my responsibilities to ensure effective planning and action assigning. 
I will establish feedback mechanisms for my support so that I know how to improve my management.

I will bring the project team together through connecting members with others who have a shared interest in particular areas of the project using established communication channels to help achieve our shared objectives. 
This personal connection with people will motivate more individuals to participate in the project. 

Regular conversations and updates on actions with each intern will ensure that they are working towards the correct goals. 
Where necessary I will promote and defend their actions in larger conversations. 
This will also enable me to highlight and control any conflicting pressures they may face to ensure project progression.

The success of this objective will be seen through the success of their objectives and overall rating on their internships. 
Success will also be seen through feedback, whether it is positive or constructive and how, in reaction, I have changed to fit to the needs of the individuals.

**Leadership Statement – Empowering**

I will provide the interns with the advice, tools and opportunities that they seek to be successful in their postings. 
I will create an inclusive and open environment where any issues or constraints can be freely discussed and resolved.

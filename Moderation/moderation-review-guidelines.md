# Moderation Report: Review Guidelines

Thank you for helping design a moderation process for AutSPACEs. Your insights will help build an online space that it is more community-led, safe, and inclusive for all.

This document contains guidelines for reading the report of the moderation session you took part in on the 30th November 2020. You now have an opportunity to read through the report and ask for changes to be made before it is published. 

The report has been sent to you in a separate document by email.

You will be paid £30 to compensate you for this work. You will be paid whether or not you ask us to make any changes.

If the process is confusing, or if you have any questions, please contact Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).

She can talk you through the summary document and take your feedback via. phone call or Zoom if you would prefer.

## What is the Moderation Report?

Two autistic researchers are leading on the task of creating a moderation process and code of conduct for AutSPACEs. We want this code of conduct to reflect your views. 

We would like to share the insights from our discussions about moderations so that 1) others can be better informed about autistic people's and parents' priorities about moderation and 2) to provide tools for others to conduct their own inclusive research. 

The report is a collection of anonymised quotes from participants of the moderation discussions. 

## How was the Moderation Report written?

### 1. Attend discussion session

You joined a discussion on Zoom to talk about the AutSPACEs project. This project involves designing an online platform to use for researching sensory processing differences and autism. The discussion focussed on how best to moderate the platform. 

The session was broken up into a set of smaller discussion groups and whole group discussions. All groups were recorded. 

### 2. Transcribe discussion

The moderation co-creation session was typed out word-for-word by a researcher. No personally identifying information was included in this process.

Personally identifying information includes:

* Names of individuals
* Precise ages
* Schools, workplaces, universities, and addresses

The recordings were then deleted.

### 3. Collect anonymised quotes

Quotations were taken from the transcription document, shortened, and organised into groups based on common themes. The quotations were arranged into different documents depending on the groups in which they were discussed. Some more edits were made to remove information which was redundant, for instance repeated words or sentences, or non-semantic additions which are common in verbal transcripts (such as, 'uhm'). Paticularly sensitive, personal detail about other people was summarised or rephrased so as to preserve as much content as possible without compromising the individual.

These insights are contained in the moderation report you have been sent. At this stage you will only have access to the quotations from the discussion groups you took part in. 

### 3.a. Remove quotes that could be harmful to autistic people

For the purposes of creating a public dataset which is autism-voice first, we have edited out comments which contain negative emotional responses, struggles, or judgements that non-autistic people have about autistic people, where the emphasis is on non-autistic people’s experiences (e.g., personal reactions to autistic people's behaviours).

We have kept comments about non-autistic people's responses to autistic people, when the emphasis is on autistic people's experiences (e.g., comments about dealing with neurotypical prejudice).

This is because feedback from the AutSPACEs community has been predominantly that there should be an emphasis on autistic people's experiences first and foremost.
Having too much focus on non-autistic views of autistic people can be damaging to autistic people and work against creating a safe space for autistic voices to be heard.

## What happens next?

### 4. Review the moderation report for the discussions you took part in

You have a chance to review the moderation report and make changes. 

We ask that you:

1. Understand the purpose of the document and what is going to happen with the insights.
2. Understand the information in the document.
3. Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised.
4. Think about whether your and others' comments are appropriate to the values of the project. Our values are to be autistic-voice first, to reflect a diversity of perspectives, and to be welcoming and inclusive. 
5. Send us any requested changes.

More information about how to review the document is available below. 

### 5. Review the Moderation Report for the group as a whole.

We will circulate a full version of the moderation report after the first set of edits have been made. You will also get a chance at this stage to request changes to the report before publication. This is so that we can make sure that the decision to publish the sessions has been made collectively. 

### 6. Publish insights online

The moderation report will be published online at: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).

The quotes from the moderation report can be used by anyone and for any purpose.
Anyone using the information must credit the Autistica/Citizen Science community.

Potential users include:

* Future contributors to this project who want to add to the insights from the moderation report. 
* Autism researchers and advocates who want to make sure they are serving the needs of autistic people.
* Parents, friends and colleagues who want to better understand how to support an autistic person they know.

**Anyone can read the quotes so it is important that you are comfortable having the information in the document be publicly available on the internet.**

### 7. Create a moderation process and code of conduct for the platform

Your thoughts and comments will be read by autistic researchers, and they will be used to help design a moderation process for the platform and write a code of conduct based on your expertise, views, hopes, and concerns. If you would like to be more involved in moderation, please contact Lotty Coupat. 

We can't do everything, but we will try our best to be guided by you. 

## Reviewing the summary document

Please review the summary document and make sure that you:

1. [Understand the purpose](#understand-the-purpose) of the document and what is going to happen with the insights.
2. [Understand the information](#understand-the-information) in the document.
3. [Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised](#ensure-the-information-is-appropriately-anonymised).
4. [Send us any requested changes](#send-us-any-requested-changes).

These steps are explained in more detail below.

### Understand the purpose

Please look through the moderation report and let us know if there is anything you would like changed.

This is so that you can be sure we are using the information you give us in a way you know about and are comfortable with.

We will take out any of your own comments if you ask us to.

You can also ask us to change comments from you, or to include additional information.
These will be included in the published summary, with a note to explain that they were changed from the original summary.

If you do not understand the purpose of reviewing the summary document please contact Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).

### Understand the information

All the quotes in the summary document have been anonymised.
This means there is no personally identifying information associated with them.

However, we have kept some information about the speaker to make sure that the quotes are interpreted in an appropriate context.

This means that although you should not be identifiable more broadly, you are likely to be identifiable to people who know you well.

To retain important information about the speaker while preserving their anonymity, we have labelled each quote with the following ***Key***:

#### Organisation

Quotes from anyone employed by **Autistica** or the **Alan Turing Institute** are marked with an italics capital letter:

* Autistica: _A_
* Turing: _T_

This tag is used to show which organisation the speaker is from.
Autistica is an autism research charity which funds the project and recruits members for the Insight Group.

The Turing is the UK's national institute for artificial intelligence and data science, and is funded to carry out the AutSPACEs project.

#### Specialist Role on Project

Quotes from researchers paid to work on the project are marked with a capital letter:

* Researcher: R

#### Expertise by lived experience

Quotes from people who are experts by experience of autism are marked with a bold capital letter:

* Autistic person: **A**
* Parent of an autistic person: **P**

#### Connection to Experience

Quotes can be in reference to direct or indirect experiences, or may be general comments.

* Direct experience or opinion of the speaker: `d`
* Indirect experience, one that was witnessed, reported, or inferred on behalf of someone else by the speaker: `i`
* General comment: `g`

The connection to the experience gives important information which might be needed to understand the comment.

A comment which is about a group of which the speaker is a member is labelled `g`, for  general - for example, "people want lots of options".

People can be members of multiple groups: the **organisation** they work for, their **specialist role in the study**, their **expertise by lived experience**, and their **connection to the experience** they are sharing.

For example:

* A quote from someone who is autistic and a parent of an autistic person speaking about an indirect experience would be identified as "**A P** `i`".
* A quote from someone who works at the Turing Institute and is a researcher and who is making a general comment would be identified as "_T_ R `g`".
* A quote from someone who works at Autistica and is a parent of an autistic person, and who is sharing a direct lived experience would be identified as "_A_ **P** `d`"

### Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised

We are balancing our responsibility to not share personal information with our goal of being as transparent as possible, and of sharing valuable insights with the research community.

It is up to you how you decide if anything needs to be changed or taken out, but here are some things you might want to think about: 

1. Would you be happy for a stranger to read this comment?
2. Is there anything in this comment which would make it clear who you are to a stranger?
3. Is there anything in this comment which would make it clear to a family member, colleague, or friend that you are the speaker.
  If so, are you happy for them to read it? 
4. Is there anything in the comment which would allow other people to know that they are being spoken about?
  If so, are you happy for them to read it?
5. If you are writing about someone else, would they be happy for the comment to be public? If you can, ask them directly.

### Send us any requested changes

We hope that we have summarised your insights from the focus groups responsibly.

If we have done our job well, it should be hard to identify who said what in the summary document.

It is very important to us that you are comfortable with the information being made publicly available.

Please email [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) with any changes you would like to be made to quotes in the document.

**Please reply in 3 weeks.**
You can ask for more time or to ask any questions about steps that are confusing.

# Moderation

This folder contains information and resources relating to co-creating a moderation process for the AutSPACEs platform. 
You are invited to help design the moderation for the AutSPACEs platform. 
To get involed in moderation, take a look at the [issues labelled moderation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AModeration) on this repository, or come to one of our meetup sessions.

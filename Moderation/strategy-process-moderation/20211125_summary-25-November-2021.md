# Meet-Up Discussion & Feedback from Kirstie 
The discussed strategies are drawn from discussion in the meet-up on November 25 2021 and notes left by Kirstie to the [#593](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/593) issue. 

## Related Issues:
* Define procedures for moderation workflow [#593](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/593)
* Write a Code of Conduct for the AutSPACEs platform  [#566](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/566)
* Collect and plan all tasks that need to be carried out for the moderation process [#532](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/532)

## Discussed strategies are as followed:
1. We will focus on **moderation policy**, **training sessions** and **reflection sessions** for moderation to minimize the infrastructure work of the AutSPACEs platform. 
2. Each experience will be moderated by **1 moderator**. If moderators are unsure about their decisions, they can ask help from administrators. Administrators will make final decisions.
3. Moderators remain anonymous to each other, but moderation decisions are visible.
4. Message feature is not going to be implemented in the platform. Moderators can use email, Slack channel, or meet-ups to discuss with each others.  
5. Administrators will be able to see moderators' names and decisions in the backend.  
6. For MVP, **appeal** feature is not a priority. Moderators will send reasons for disapproval to users in the first hand and users are supposed to edit their answers based on the advice. If users are still not satisfied with the reasons, they can email administrators for explanation.  
7. At current stage, the three warning mechanism will be held off from the moderation process.
8. The platform will aim to have a significant number of autistic moderators
9. The platform does not need consider a feature for selecting moderators. 
10. For the criteria of new moderators, they will have to be familiar with the code of conduct and must be able to apply them (via. practice cases).

# Moderating with AutSPACEs

Thank you for your interest in becoming a moderator for AutSPACEs. This is a hugely important and valuable role. As a moderator you will have a direct impact on the experiences of people using the AutSPACEs platform. You can help ensure that AutSPACEs is a welcoming and inclusive space where autistic people can be heard.

## What to expect as an AutSPACEs moderator

As a moderator, your role will be to read experiences which people using the AutSPACEs platform have chosen to share publicly. You will then use the AutSPACEs Code of Conduct to assess whether each story is suitable for publication on AutSPACEs. 

## Benefits of moderating 

### Helping the autism community 

Moderation is absolutely essential to creating a welcoming and inclusive space for autistic people and their supporters online. Unfortunately, autistic people are more likely to encounter problems such as bullying and harassment online which may make their experience negative or prevent them from benefiting from online communities. At AutSPACEs we want to change that by creating a friendly, safe, autistic-voice-first space which diverse autistic people can trust. As a moderator, you can support other autistic people and their allies by making sure that when they come to AutSPACEs they are protected and can feel comfortable sharing their experiences. 

### Having power

As an AutSPACEs moderator, you have a direct say in what gets published. You can also influence the way the platform is run and the values that it upholds. We want you to have power and control over AutSPACEs, because it is your space and exists to support you. If you are frustrated about how autistic people are treated or spoken about online, by becoming an AutSPACEs moderator you can take direct action to change that and create a different space.

### Gaining skills 

Moderation skills are hugely valuable. As a moderator for AutSPACEs you will gain specific skills and understanding about what to look for when you moderate online posts, and how to assess them using a code of conduct. Reading others’ experiences will also broaden your perspective and you will be able to develop your empathy and awareness. 

### Flexibility 

As a moderator, the amount of time you want to put in is up to you. You will not be required to moderate for any set number of hours, and you can stop at any time if you do not wish to continue. It is an entirely flexible volunteering role which you can do from the comfort of your own home. 

## Risks of moderating 

As an AutSPACEs moderator, you will be in a position to shield others from potentially upsetting, triggering, explicit or abusive content. This means you will have to be prepared to read that content. Please therefore only apply to become an AutSPACEs moderator if you are psychologically robust and prepared to encounter such content. 

If you find that you are distressed, concerned, or negatively affected in any way by your experiences as a moderator, please reach out to a member of the moderator team [Bastian?, Georgia?] and we will support you.  

## How to moderate: step by step

* Apply to become a moderator [we need to determine this process]
* Complete moderator onboarding [this also needs to be determined]
* Create a moderator account on AutSPACEs * Log in to AutSPACEs using your moderator account and click on the “moderate” tab at the top menu bar to view stories you can moderate. Here you will see a list of experiences which you can moderate. 
* You will get a snippet view of each experience at first. If it isn’t something you want to read more of or look at, do not expand the snippet view. It will be passed on to another moderator to look at after 24 hours.
* You can moderate as many or as few experiences as you like, and spend as much or as little time moderating as you want to.  * It is vital that when you moderate you use the Code of Conduct to make your decisions. The Code of Conduct has been developed by an autism community to serve an autism community. Following the Code of Conduct is the fairest way of moderating. This is because by following the Code of Conduct, we can make sure that all users of the platform are treated the same, know what to expect, and can understand why decisions have been made. 
* For each experience you moderate, you have four assessment options based on a “traffic lights” system:
> - Green: the experience follows the AutSPACEs code of conduct and there is no or minimal risk to readers. If you choose this option, the person who shared it will be notified and the experience will be published on the AutSPACEs platform and will be available for anyone to read who comes to the platform. 
> - Amber: the experience follows the AutSPACEs code of conduct, and there is some potential risk to readers. For example, it might include upsetting or triggering content. [Whenever you give an amber rating, you will be prompted to add some keywords to explain the nature of the distressing content, for instance, “bullying”, “anorexia”, “self-harm”.]  If you choose this option, the person who shared it will be notified and the experience will be published on the AutSPACEs platform in a hidden view with a trigger warning. Readers will be able to make their own judgement about whether they want to read the story. It will not appear in searches where users have opted not to view potentially triggering content. 
> - Red: the experience does not follow the code of conduct. You will be asked for the part of the code of conduct which the experience does not follow. You should try to copy the code of conduct as closely as possible (e.g. “wording discriminates against disability”). This is so that the response is as objective and impersonal as possible, so that the reason is clear and the user does not feel personally attacked. The user will be notified, and the experience will not be published on the AutSPACEs platform. [It will still be available to the user to make changes and resubmit if they wish].
> - You may also flag the experience for another moderator to look at if you are unsure what assessment to make or if you would like another view. 
When you assess an experience as a moderator, the person who shared the story will be notified that a decision has been made and what the decision is, but you will be completely anonymous, and they will not know that you have made the decision. They will not be able to contact you directly, but they may contact the project team if they wish.
* Once an experience has been given to you to moderate, you have 24 hours to make an assessment decision. After 24 hours, the story will be passed on to another moderator to look at. Do not feel any pressure to keep to this timeframe. The 24 hour window is just to make sure that someone is able to look at the experience and the user who entered it is not waiting. 
* If, while moderating, you have any suggestions about the code of conduct or moderation process please let us know by sharing your feedback using the Google Form link on the moderation page. The Code of Conduct is a “living document” which you can influence if you want the platform to be moderated differently.

# Code of Conduct

## Introduction 
The AutSPACEs platform is an online space which puts autistic people first. 
We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming place for autistic people and their supporters to share experiences, knowing their voices will be heard and their contributions recognised.
AutSPACEs allows users to share stories publicly with other users as well as privately with researchers. 
In order for the platform to be a respectful and welcoming place for autistic people and other members of the community, everyone sharing a story publicly will be required to follow this code of conduct. Before they are published all stories will be reviewed by a moderator who will use this document as guidance when making decisions as to whether a post can be approved or not. 
This code of conduct exists for clarity and fairness, as well as to ensure the values of AutSPACEs are upheld. 
It was co-written by autistic people, the parents and carers of autistic people, and researchers with expertise in creating inclusive online spaces.
The lead investigator of AutSPACEs - [] - is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct and overseeing the moderation process. 
They can be contacted by emailing []. Reports may be reviewed by other members of the research team, unless there is a conflict of interest, and will be kept confidential.

## What the platform is and isn't for 
The primary purpose of the platform is to gather data about sensory processing and navigating environments in order to make the world more accessible to autistic people. In order for a story to be approved by moderators it must be relevant to this. This doesn’t mean you can’t write about other things, as long as they relate to sensory experiences. The data we are collecting is also for a specific demographic: all stories must be about experiences of someone who is over the age of 18 at the time of posting. Entries about the past before the user was 18 are permitted. For instance, an 18 year old could post about an experience they had when they were 10, but a 10 year-old would not be permitted to post.
As this is a data collection platform, users will have the option to share their stories with both researchers and/or the public. Further information about how stories will be used by researchers is available [insert link]. Only stories posted to the public will be moderated, all information below.
As much as we would like to be able to help everyone with everything, that is unfortunately out of the scope of this project. AutSPACEs cannot offer professional support, however, we can link you to appropriate sources if necessary. 
 
## What is considered to be sensory

People with autism often have sensory differences. This means their senses may be weaker or stronger than those who are neurotypical. This is why navigating and coping in the world can be very difficult for people with autism.
There are seven senses:
Sight
Hearing
Smell
Taste
Touch
Balance (Vestibular)
Body Awareness (Proprioception)

## What is and isn't acceptable to be mentioned in stories

AutSPACEs is designed to be a welcoming and safe place for all people with autism to share and read experiences. In order to ensure this we have created a Red and Amber list of words and topics that may be offensive or triggering to some users. 
The purpose of having the Red category is to make sure we don’t publish experiences which contravene our values of mutual respect, diversity, and inclusion, or which cause a risk to the person who posts the experience or others. Examples of content marked Red would be direct or indirect attacks on people for being autistic, referring to autism as a dysfunction, using an offensive or prejudicial term to describe someone. Explicitly including someone’s identity or sensitive data is sticlty forbidden, examples of sensitive data are listed below. 
A person’s first name and/or surname
Someone’s contact details including:  address, phone number, school, email address or place of work
Anything that could distinguish that person from others (ie, hair colour or skin tone)

 
The purpose of having the Amber list is to help users identify posts that may find triggering or distressing before they read them, to avoid harm to users of AutSPACEs. While some people may be sensitive to them, it is important that these experiences are available, and that users are free to express themselves. Examples of content marked Amber might be an account of bullying, a traumatic home environment, or descriptions of verbal abuse which a user has experienced. 
Stories that include Red content will automatically be disapproved. Those regarded as Amber will be approved but may be labelled as ‘triggering’ when posted on the platform. 
Any post which discriminates or belittles anyone based on the below categories will be regarded as Red. 
* Neurodiversity
* Gender Identity and/or Expression
* Sexual Orientation
* Disability and/or Health
* Physical Appearance (eg. skin colour, body size, etc.)
* Nationality, Citizenship and Ethnic or Social Origin
* Religion/Belief (or lack thereof)
* Pregnancy and/or Familial Status
* Veteran Status
* Genetic Information
* Property and/or Socio-Economic Status
* Technical Preferences
* Experience Level

 
All racial slurs [insert link to external list of racial slurs] will automatically be considered Red whether they are direct or indirect comments. Swear words and disability slurs will be rated Amber.
Below is a list of topics that may be triggering to some users. All stories that refer to these topics will be listed as Amber.
Abuse (physical, sexual, emotional and verbal)
Violence and Assault
Drug and/or Alcohol use
Mental Health Issues
Negative body image

 
# Additional guidelines for writing on behalf of others

While AutSPACEs exists as a platform where autistic people can share their own stories, we are aware that there will be some cases where autistic people will need support to use the platform or require others may share experiences on their behalf. All of the above rules above are still in place when posting on behalf of others, and anything which breaks them will be automatically disapproved for publication on the AutSPACEs platform.
These are a series of questions to prompt you to think about how you can best share a story that is not your own, in order to make sure the story is respectful, appropriate, and representative. 
Can the person who you are writing about share their own story with support? 

If so, please support them to share their own experience, rather than writing about their experience yourself on their behalf. For instance, if they can speak but not write, it is better to allow them to dictate, and try to write what they are saying as accurately as possible, than to write your own version of their story. It is also a good idea to show what you wish to share to the person who you are writing on behalf of. If you can, try to find out if this reflects their experience and if you can change it to make it better. 
Have they consented to you writing on their behalf?

If so, that’s great. If not, please seek their consent. 
If they do not give their consent, do not share their story, even if you think it would benefit them if it is shared. If they are not able to meaningfully consent, then please share only if you think that it is in their best interests to do so. 
Are you the right person to share this story? 

If there is someone else who has a closer personal connection to the person whose story you would like to be shared on the platform, or who is better qualified to so, consider asking them to share the story instead. You may also wish to share your version of the story with others who know the person well to make it more accurate.
Are you making any assumptions or inferences about the autistic person you are sharing on behalf of?

It is very natural to think we know what is going on in other people’s minds, and sometimes we can talk about this as a fact without even noticing we are doing so. These are not facts but inferences. It is better to stick to telling us what you observed about the autistic person you are writing on behalf of rather than making assumptions about what they think or feel. 
>E.g. don’t write, “my autistic son was stressed because the train was loud’, 
>Please write, ‘My autistic son shouted and covered his ears when a train passed him loudly. This happens frequently.’’ 

The aim of entering on behalf of others should be in the service of autistic people’s wellbeing. 
If you need more support as a carer or parent, we recommend these resources: [link to resources?]
Are you adding subjective and personal details which are your own? 
It is better to write neutrally about the things you are observing. 
Focus on the experience of the autistic person you are writing on behalf of. Don’t focus on your own experiences or the experiences of other people, except when it is relevant to the autistic person’s experience. In particular, do not use this space for venting or complaining about autistic people.   
>E.g. don’t write, “I hate it when my autistic son makes a scene in the supermarket, it’s so embarrassing”, 
>Please write, “my autistic son cried and stood still in a busy supermarket. Some people around us showed negative expressions and body language while this happened. This usually  occurs when we go to the supermarket.” 

## Responding to others' stories
AutSPACEs is designed to be a safe space where people can post their experiences without the fear of receiving negative or upsetting responses. In order to maintain this safety there is no comment section on the site. Any stories posted as a direct response to another post will be disapproved. 
However, as AutSPACEs is an anonymous platform, it is permissible to discuss stories on other sites. 

## Consequences for disapproved posts 
If you post a story that the moderators believe goes against this Code of Conduct it will be disapproved. 
You will have the opportunity to edit and resubmit the story. Each time someone posts a story that is disapproved they will receive a warning. 
We appreciate that not everyone thinks or communicates in the same way, which is why this guide has been written. 
Each case will be viewed individually and if you are unsure why a story was disapproved you contact us for an explanation.

# How we made the code-of-conduct

The code of conduct and moderation guidelines have been co-created with the AutSPACEs autism community. 
It is a 'living document', which means that you are always welcome to give us feedback so that we can improve it.
We have been working on moderation in the AutSPACEs project management repository. You can find out more or take part by looking at the issues and Milestones labeled [Moderation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3AModeration).

All of our decisions about the code of conduct and moderation process have been made based on extensive community discussions so it can best reflect and balance the needs and priorities of a diverse autism community. 
You can read the content of many of those discussions in the [Community Recommendations](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/moderation-co-creation.) section of our project management GitHub repository.

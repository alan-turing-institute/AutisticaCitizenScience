> This file documents all the decisions that have been discussed during the community meet-ups from November 2021 to December 2021. 

> We will focus on **the moderation policy, training sessions and reflection sessions for moderation** to minimize the infrastructure work required from the AutSPACEs platform.


* Each experience will be moderated by **1 moderator**.
* If moderators are unsure about their decisions, they can **flag the experiences as ambiguous**. The ambiguous experiences will be moderated by reviewers. 
* Moderators remain **anonymous** to each other, but moderation decisions are **visible**. Only administrators can see moderators' names and decisions in the database.
* Moderators will select experiences on their own for moderation. Once experiences are selected, moderators should moderate them within 24 hours. Otherwise, the experiences will be put back into the pool.
* **Appeal requests** will be collected through Google Form and be sent to reviewers. 
* **Harmful reports** will be collected through Google Form and be sent to moderators. Moderators will re-label the mentioned experiences based on the reports. 
* Email should be avoided to use as the means of the communication in the platform as it is not user-friendly and can be quite hard to document.

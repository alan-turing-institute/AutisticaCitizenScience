# Project Management

### Overview

The [study protocol](/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A9_StudyProtocol.pdf) is a description of the steps that core research team members should take to manage the project.

The [participant information sheet](participant-information-sheet.md) ([PDF format](A7_ParticipantInformationSheet.pdf)) describes the project for anyone who would like to take part.

The [project values](project-values.md) document outlines the guiding principles for the project.
The [planned outputs](planned-outputs.md) document details the projected deliverables.
These are combined into one document in [PDF format](A2_ValuesAndOutcomes.pdf).

### Participation

The [consent form](A6_ConsentForm.pdf) is used for in person focus group and 1:1 user testing sessions.

Participants can join the community by joining Autistica's Discover Network or the Autism Insight Group by submitting the [recruitment form](A5_AutismInsightGroupRecruitmentForm.pdf).

Online participation can also be completed via the online google form ([http://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm](http://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm)), a PDF copy of which is available [here](A1_OnlineSurvey.pdf).

### Building a safe community

The guidance [to build a safe community](building-a-safe-community.md) ([PDF format](A4_BuildingASafeCommunity.pdf)) includes reporting and intervention processes for safeguarding of community members and enforcement of the project's [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ([PDF format](A3_CodeOfConduct.pdf)).

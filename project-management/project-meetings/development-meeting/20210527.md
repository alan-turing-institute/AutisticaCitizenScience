Attendees:
JK, LC, GA, SR, AR

Aims:
- Hand over tasks from JK to SR and AR
- AR and SR to know what they are to work on and building towards.

SR to tell us what she’s been working on and where she is up to:
-	Going through repository and looking at issues for milestone 2 
-	MVP landing page
-	Mock run – working on HTML, Django and putting that together to create a landing page with videos and pictures and email box
-	Working on other issues such as sign up flow and information about AutSPACEs

GA roadmap update:
-	Handing over to LC
-	MVP list – reduced larger list 

> Milestone 1 – Open Humans infrastructure
> 
> Milestone 2 – necessary for the MVP to be prototyped
> 
> Milestone 3 - integration with OH, functional MVP 
> 
> Milestone 4 - accessibility checks
> 
> Milestone 5 – deploy MVP platform 
> 
> Milestone 6 – platform second phase (larger requirements list), iterating, developing, adding more features

-	LC to add in issues and small tasks to wider roadmap
-	Next steps – markdown version of roadmap
-	Specific technical things around individual issues – SR has been working on this and AR will be joining on this work 
-	Some issues in milestones are older and need to be closed
-	LC action – milestones have no random issues, those are closed
-	LC action – assign issues to individuals

Milestone around OH collecting data – Milestone 4 
-	SR has been working on the integration, still unsure on how to connect
-	Share experience flow will involve this integration with OH
-	LC take this task offline to discuss with whoever is working on this issues

KW confirm – is SR following the instruction that JK wrote – trying to replicate from figma? 
- SR has followed instructions for this 
- SR started to create in local host the Django pages

Any other work/steps that are building up from JK
-	JK: How are the pages going to connect together? 
-	LC and JK to work on creating user flow
-	JK: SR and AR are doing great so far 
-	SR to create [WIP] PR for work

SR:
-	Starting on issues from the Milestone 2 
-	Adding logos and text to the land up page and sign-up button
-	JK to review work when it needs to close
-	Showing landing page/home page
-	Ideas/next steps
o	Add in link to sign up to newsletter (mail list) – issues with GDPR
o	Navigation bar
o	Logos
-	Trying to get it done by the end of the week

JK: Interest about navigation issue and how all the pages link together
- SR: following figma wireframe to base what needs to be done, as a way to visualise it
- LC and JK to have catch up on figma board and where everything sits together 

JK commits to two meetings in the next week – 1) collaborate with LC on user flow and navigation 2) Code update with AR and SR

We want to ensure there is understanding on the way we go forward 

JK to show where code is
-	Needs to show to know where you are going 
-	../pages/template – where all the code lies 
-	rst. 
-	SR and AR to familiarise themselves with all these docs
-	These documents are more around serving the website
../server/apps/main/template/main  where main landing page and code is
- AR: to clarify whether this code is already connected to OH already 
-	JK: it integrates with the platform, but not integrated publicly, this needs to be done eventually – you can upload data to OH 
-	Need user connection to the OH 
- GA: milestone 3 for OH integration, maybe that doesn’t fit into it, need to map out how the user data fits in – how to figure out the data flow
-	JK/SR/AR: Look at milestone 3 and map out the data flow 
-	Link MVP and tasks on the page to link to the OH 

Iron out the flow of the wire frame – LC and JK 
-	Map out the process flow of the platform and the different 
- Can’t look at OH integration and front-end building separately – milestone 2 and 3 to interlink
-	No back-end management as that is handled by the OH platform 
-	API = Open Humans 
-	All we need to do is define the front end and implement the API calls to get the information and show it in the respective webpages
- Local database that we use for front-end purpose – not for OH specifically – data management for all clients 

Next steps for SR and AR:
Wait on wireframe/user flow until finalised
- for now focus on the source code and understanding the additional things/artefacts that need to be added
- the landing page
- documenting what you have been doing

Next goal: 
-	Modify code to remove any unnecessary coding withing that

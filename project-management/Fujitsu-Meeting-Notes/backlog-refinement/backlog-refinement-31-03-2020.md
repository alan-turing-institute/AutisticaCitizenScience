### The Front-End Interface: High Level Requirements

* Clearly and accessibly informs users about the project, the platform, what it is for and how to use it.
* Registers users and collects necessary demographic information, such as connection to autism, and is compliant with the UK Data Protection Act.
* Takes input from users reporting their experiences navigating different sensory environments.
* Securely transfers data from users categorised as usable for research and/or usable for public view, or neither, to the Open Humans backend file management system.
* Allows moderation of input before it is made public.
* Presents users with their own data and consent decisions.
* Displays experiences that have been consented for public view to any visitor of the website.


### Backlog Prioritisation: 

* Fujitsu team to review and agree business requirements: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/94
* Review and agree agile open source working process: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/97
* Create sprint report and demo Video https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/116
    * Create documentation on wireframes, sprint report (preparatory work) provide links on GitHub to where hosted - record of decisions made and processes done - co-working session Georgia and Chris to put everything on GitHub
* Complete Sprint Meetings Documentation: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/123
* Document backlog definitions (user stories and goals): https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/103
* Link 1:1 user testing documentation to ways of working: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/115
    Speak to community members to clarify structure they would like to be followed - document conversations - make this part of the     review of the workflow documentation pull requests (linked above)
* Move closed work on wireframes and personas onto main GitHub repo
* Drill down into business requirements to clarify acceptance criteria: speak to the community
* (How): Define strategy for how will go about talking to community to gather info for acceptance criteria - process of speaking to community can happen at the same time - create in conjunction with the community so community driven 

### GA Actions: 

* Publish summaries on GitHub (put into markdown and incorporate SI's suggestions)
* Go through Repo and organise - pull requests, labels, issues, milestones 
* Write up meeting on 27th put into markdown 
* Put Fujitsu team in touch with community member for process review  
* Set up co-working session with CL 

### Other Notes

* Focus on documentation, process, and defining acceptance criteria before development work begins
* Full sprint not yet in progress - preparatory work has occured, but interative design not yet in place - but a full sprint report will be published 
* Tease out items from wireframe that need to be developed first

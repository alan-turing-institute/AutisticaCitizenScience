### Note on ways of working

Due to the structure of the project at the beginning of this sprint Chris Legg chose to create a wireframe to give a starting point to the development.
The user stories for this sprint were lifted from business goals and objectives built into the documentation.
At the time the community feedback user stories were in development and not accessible to the team so the links to the issue numbers couldn't be added without facing repetition later in the project.
This has caused a delay in the publishing of this sprint report.

### Issues Opened

These tasks were opened during the sprint but no work was done to address them.

* [#74](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/74): Platform Requirements - Established some further learning required around GDPR / what support will be required from OH

### Challenges

The team met the following challenges or blockers during this sprint

* Allocation of Developers to the project to aid full Sprint Delivery
* Sign off of internal video from marketing adds 72 hours to process of demo video review
* New tooling methods - GitHub over Jira / Slack - more visibility needed on method of upload and locations
* Misunderstanding around timely delivery of Sprint Demo Video for Sprint 1 given Developers not stood up and extended wireframe task set as first Sprint for UX and Developers
* MVP issue grouping from user stories

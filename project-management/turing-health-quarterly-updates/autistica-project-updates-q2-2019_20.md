## Notable activity/outcomes in research progress


### Online collaboration

We have had additional collaboration from members of the autistic community on our online channels, including GitHub and our Google Forms survey.
Guidelines for assessing the dataset have been co-produced with an autistic collaborator via. the GitHub repository
•	There are now 40 people on the project newsletter mailing list. Archives of monthly updates from October and November are available at https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience/archive).
•	The project tasks have been turned into GitHub issues and are organised into milestones and labelled for ease of collaboration. 


Members of the autistic community have contributed to the project via channels including GitHub issues, and an "always open" Google Forms survey: [https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm](https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm).
The data has been consented to be made publicly available and is available (after moderation for accidental personal information disclosure) at in our GitHub repository at [community-recommendations/GoogleFormResponses.pdf](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/GoogleFormResponses.pdf).

### Participatory co-design activities

We ran three focus groups with autistic people, their families and carers, to gather feedback from the community.
These focus groups were hosted at Fujitsu and included developers with and without personal connections to autism. 
Members of Autistica’s Insight Group were paid £75 each for their time.
During the focus groups we asked each participant to describe their motivations for supporting the platform to ensure our work is aligned with their needs.
We demonstrated the first iteration of the citizen science platform and discussed ways to make sure that it was accessible for as many people as possible.
The conversations also included moderation of content on the platform, soliciting informed consent from autistic people with learning difficulties, contributing pathways to designing the platform, an explanation of open source and transparent software development.

### Pro-bono support from Fujitsu

Autistica are Fujitsu's charity partner (https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/about/local/corporate-responsibility/charity-partner).
Researchers are liaising with a dedicated development team from Fujitsu, who have begun to build early prototypes of the user interface.
All work is being undertaken publicly on GitHub (https://github.com/fjAutisticaCitizenScience/AutisticaCitizenScience). 
In addition to providing web development support Fujitsu hosted the three focus groups in September 2019 at their offices in London.

### Software and infrastructure development

A prototype of the backend infrastructure has been developed in collaboration with Bastian Greshake Tzovoras, Director of Research at Open Humans Foundation (https://www.openhumans.org).
It is publicly hosted at [https://autistica-demo-deployment.herokuapp.com](https://autistica-demo-deployment.herokuapp.com) and available under an open source licence on GitHub [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autistica-filemanagement-demo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autistica-filemanagement-demo).

### End-user engagement

We have been approached by a number of influential organisations who are interested in using the outcomes from the focus groups and the citizen science project itself to understand how they can implement recommendations from the research to improve the lives of autistic people.

## Presentations

Georgia Atikenhead and community member Thomas Augur presented the project at the British Library’s National Inclusion Week community event.
They engaged with British Library staff to discuss how the research could have positive impact on the lives of neurodivergent people and demonstrated how to get involved with the project.

# Community Wireframe Feedback Mechanism 

# Introduction

The mechanism will cover all of the Sprints so feedback can be, gathered on each stage. The community feedback on the wireframes is part of a bigger, community engagement strategy.

It has been, defined that the community will always be one sprint behind the development team in providing feedback. This will create time for the community to review what, has, been produced and push this feedback back into the User Experience Life Cycle of the project.

# Process Steps:

# Step 1: Introductory Email - Project & Feedback Task 

Bring community to the Wireframe Feedback Page this will be achieved by emailing – Community members by grouped categories. Different groups will be invited, to participate using an introductory email – which will provide a brief introduction, to the project and the feedback task. The email will link to the Community Wireframe Feedback page and outline the given Feedback Steps.

Subject: Feedback Needed
Dear … (By full name)
Welcome… 

We wanted to introduce you to the project, if you were not already aware of it. 
Autistica’s Citizen Science Platform.

The purpose of this study is to co-design and co-produce a framework for ethical, participatory, citizen science. We cannot build this tool without the input of a diverse community of autistic people and their relatives and carers. We also welcome open source developers to help us build this platform. 

The first phase of this project is to co-design the online platform by identifying priorities and requirements from our community members. 

Please visit link below for more general information about the project: https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/

Feedback

We need feedback from the community on the Sprint wireframes (platform designs) for Sprint 1 / 2 / 3 and into the future with further Sprints please help us co-design the platform together.

Your feedback would, be very much appreciated and will help us to develop this platform for the autistic community.

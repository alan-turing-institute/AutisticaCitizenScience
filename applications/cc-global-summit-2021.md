AutSPACEs: co-creating an open citizen science platform

## Abstract

We are a community of citizen/professional scientists and open-source developers building a citizen science platform to investigate sensory processing and autism. The data gathered will be used to make environments such as hospitals and schools more enabling for autistic people. We follow best practices for open-source research adapted by and for neurodiverse people. The platform is open and can be modified for other research, and we are developing a participatory framework which can guide other research. In this session we present the platform/research findings and invite collaborators.

## Diversity

This session focusses on empowering a neurodiverse community. We explore intersectional effects of autism and systemic barriers. Despite educational attainment and ability, autistic people are excluded from positions of power: just 22% of autistic people in the UK are employed, for instance. Practising the principles of participatory science we advocate, this session is run by an autistic citizen scientist, a professional researcher, and an open-source developer. Our diversity in terms of gender, sexual-orientation, neurodiversity, citizenship, and ethnicity is a key strength of our community

## Outcomes

1)Sharing a case study of open, participatory research in practice, and the importance of openly licensedd research 2)Presenting FAIR principles for open licensinig in the context of sensitive data 3)Raising awareness of challenges faced by neurodiverse people, and some mitigating strategies 3)Providing an opportunity to be involved in world-class research and gain experience of an open-source, open-licensed project 4)Openly licensed tools and materials to support future research. We also hope to engage with people who have influence to use new our data to make environments more accessible. 

## Full Description

This session shares progress from a pioneering, community-led research project: AutSPACEs. AutSPACEs is a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for AI and data science, and Autistica, a UK-based autism research charity. We are a neurodiverse community of citizen/professional scientists and open-source developers. building a citizen science platform to investigate sensory processing and autism.

Sensory processing differences affect up to 90% of autistic people, yet the impact this has on the daily lives of individuals is not well-known. Understanding the conditions which make environments better suited to autistic people with sensory differences requires rich, nuanced data. To gather this, we are developing an online platform designed by and for autistic people. The dataset can be used to adapt environments such as schools, hospitals, and workplaces to be more enabling for autistic people. Our research method is unique in combining open-source development, citizen science, and participatory research to empower autistic people throughout the research process.

The project is autism-voice first but is open to all. The data we gather, all code, protocols, working notes, project plans, research outputs, and tasks are openly published on our GitHub repositories, along with accompanying documentation and multiple routes to involvement. While AutSPACEs seeks to address a specific research question, it has much broader implications. The project outputs will be an open, citizen science platform which can be easily adapted to answer other research questions, along with a participatory framework for open research which can be used for other projects. We are already exploring applications for investigating co-occurring conditions.

AutSPACEs follows best practices for open-source research and development adapted by and for neurodiverse populations. In this interactive session, we will firstly present AutSPACEs, giving a brief overview of the research context and raison d’être of the project. We will detail our approach and methods of working openly, including how we follow FAIR principles of data use. We will then demonstrate the platform prototype and share a variety of routes to involvement. All attendees are warmly invited to contribute or join future community meet-up sessions to learn more. We will also invite audience members to consider neurodiversity in their own practices and offer tools to support increasing engagement. We hope to use this opportunity to connect with activists, researchers, community-managers, and members of the creative commons community who can benefit from the tools and practices being openly developed for AutSPACEs. We hope to engage with policymakers, community managers, and those in positions of influence who can use data on sensory processing differences and the barriers autistic people face to make spaces more accessible for autistic people, and share how vital open licenses are.

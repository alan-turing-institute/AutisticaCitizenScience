# Week 2
This week I completed making the Share Experiences Page according to the simplified wireframes and sent a [PR](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/pull/114)
I also tried integrating the landing page into the site and connecting it with the existing sign in authorisation to Open Humans which worked. The View Experiences page handled by another contributor had a couple of issues regarding Bootstrap. I’ve helped her out with what needs to be done so that can be ready to integrate into the site. In addition to this, I helped other new contributors with building the site locally and explaining the entire code base to them so that they know where exactly to contribute. As of now, we’d almost be completing Milestone 2 and we’ll be starting Milestone 3.

My plan for next week is to integrate all the static pages from Milestone 2 into the site so that I have the basic user flow in place. I will also create a small basic guide for Bootstrap in the repository for beginners to refer to it while contributing as instructed by the community manager.

As of this week, no blockers have popped up.

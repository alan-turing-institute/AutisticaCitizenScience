# Week 3 (21st June - 27th June)
This week I integrated my pages into Django where now you can enter experiences through that page and it will be stored in a local database for now. The landing page for now contains the sign in button which directs the user to Open Humans for project authorisation. By the end of this week, we should have an MVP of the site up and running.

My plan for next week is to ensure that MVP is set up and presented to the community in the week after.

One blocker I had was to completely finalise on a definite sign up flow for the site. I would be talking to Bastian who is a part of Open Humans to get some guidance on how to go about this and also get that finalised by next week.

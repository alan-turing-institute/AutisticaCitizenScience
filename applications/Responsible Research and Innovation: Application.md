# Responsible Research and Innovation: Application

## Your statement of motivation

### Why are you applying and what do you hope to gain from the course?

I am a researcher at The Turing working on the participatory co-design of a citizen science platform, AutSPACEs, which will be used to investigate how sensory processing differences impact autistic people in their daily lives. 
Conducting this research responsibly and with high ethical standards is of paramount importance, and the aspiration is to develop responsible, participatory tools and methods which can further benefit other research projects. 
By continuing to develop and broaden skills and understanding in ethical research practices, I can bring additional skills, knowledge and ideas to enhance the AutSPACEs project. 
The RRI course provides breadth and depth of training across a number of dimensions highly relevant to my current work. 

Further, I would like to contribute to, and learn from, a community with shared values across a range of backgrounds and fields of expertise. 
I believe that such a community is likely to be mutually supportive, and provide fertile grounds for collaboration, peer support, and encouragement. 
I am committed to ethical research, and the training will support foundations of ethical principles and practice to guide my academic career going forwards, both by providing opportunities for both learning and for making connections. 

By offering a broad curriculum and giving access to diverse perspectives, I also hope the training will help me to better understand how learnings from AutSPACEs can be applied to a broad range of cases, and how I can build expansiveness and reusability for this project, and my research more generally. 


### What is your experience with Responsible Research Innovation? Note having previous experience is not a requirement.

Responsible research and innovation is core to my current work, which has the development of participatory methodologies as a key focus. 
I have particular knowledge about RRI in the field of autism, as well as in citizen science. 
Much of my research involves thinking about and managing responsible engagement throughout the research cycle, as well as considering how power dynamics impact the production and dissemination of knowledge, and the ethical implications of how science is socially and structurally embedded. 
I am a member of the participatory science special interest group at The Turing, and I also have experience of RRI through involvement with The Turing Way community. 
Prior to the Turing I have experience of RRI via. behavioural insights research, and supporting digital transformation strategies, for the UK government. 

I do not have experience with AI research or engineering, other than tangentially, so I am eager to learn from the modules on responsible model development and system development, and to engage in discussions with people who have more of a technical background/specialisms in AI and software development.

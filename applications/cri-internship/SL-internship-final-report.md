## About Me
Hi everyone. I am Soledad, a Digital Sciences master student at the UniversiÃ© de Paris. I joined AutSPACEs as a frontend development intern in Oct. 2021 and will finish it by the end of Feb. 2022. 

## Overview
During my internship, I have been working in the design system, user research and frontend development of the AutSPACEs platform. Here is my [final progress of the platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/93649d15dd1d4b95885fc4ecae7868af8c011965/platform-designs/wireframes/platform-prototype-21-02-2022.md) 

## User Experience Research
With the instructions from SB, I managed to start the user research work and received feedback from the bi-weekly meet-ups to ensure that the platform features and information were really for end users. For the research, I have done the following work: 
1) analyzed the most needed features from the previous feedback & identified the most needed one and documented them on the [feedback summary slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/2/d/1VTJbexcdFIkcNOYoW9C61iOVWgRw46ec08PSIv9flPs/edit#slide=id.gf192724d12_0_0)
2) created [user stories](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-research/Personas)
3) worked on the [user need matrices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11vbZ0TYvY2qq-EgF5IHNowC4Mfksf_fekJ5rUXY4deM/edit#gid=0) and user journeys

## Design System 
After SB identifying the color palette of the platform, I have done the followwing work:
1) mocked up low fidelity and high fidelity wireframes
2) iterated the design and collected feedback in the bi-weekly meet-ups
3) re-designed the platform so that the design was consistent 
4) created the design code documentation

## Information Architecture
1) created information architecture for the previous MVP 
2) identified the information flow per page
3) created a new information architecture diagram for the current platform

## Moderation 
1) identified the moderation workflow
    * selecting new stories, moderating new stories, moderating edited stories, and moderating harmful reports
2) designed and iterated the moderation workflow based on the community's feedback 
3) simplified and identified key features for moderation workflow for MVP deployment  
4) documented the moderation decision process on the github repo

## Frontend Development 
1) unified the boostrap and coded the wireframes out 
2) Refactored the frontend codes & set templates for navigation and footer 
3) Re-coded the following pages: Homepage, View Stories, Share Stories, My Stories, and Registration
4) Coded the following new pages: What Autism Is and About US

## Community 
1) hosted bi-weekly meetings, shared monthly progress, and presented platform development work
2) updated information on social platforms: Twitter, TinyLetter, and Slack


## Reflections
I love how supportive the AutSPACEs community is and I have learned a lot from this project. Here are some main aspects where I acquired skills during my internship:
* Frontend Development: This is my first web development project and I was a little bit unsure about my skills in the first hand. With the supports and the freedom the team provided, I got to improve my skills in self-learning from [freecodeacademy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). Every time when I stumbled upon questions I could not solve on my own, I would use Slack for help. As JK said, we were not only building the project, but we were building ourselves as well. In the end, I felt quite happy to see how my skills could contribute to the platform.
* UX Research: I have never done user research before. With the guidance from SB, I have learned and experienced so much! I learned why it way a key to conduct a thorough user research before developing a product and the different design methods to conduct it. Through the valuable feedback from bi-weekly meet-ups, I got to iterate the design and practice the methods shared by SB. This UX learning provided me a new perspective in understanding the development of a project and I would keep it in mind for my future development journey. 
* Community: Honestly speaking, I was quite nervous in hosting the meet-ups in the first month. The meet-up memebers are really nice and supportive. Their friendlieness later dismissed my anxiety away. ðŸŒ» With them, I learned how to conduct user researches, collect feedback for the platform, how to deliver presentations, and how to host meetings. 
* Project management: From this project, I see that it is not easy to run participatory projects as there would be lots of uncertainties in the road. From KW, GA, and SB, I learned from the best in how to support voluntary contributors, how to build flexibility in organizing tasks and how to maintain the projects with thorough documentation. This journey let me understand the project management in a new perspective and let me really appreciate each contribution in open source and participatory projects. 

## Future Work
I am waiting the review for my frontend development work and I will ensure that the codes will be properly programmed and do not have errors when being integrated. In future, I'd love to continue contributing on the frontend development part and co-work the development with other developers. I am also more than happy to share my experiences out and help other contributors for onboarding as well. : )

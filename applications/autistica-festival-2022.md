AutSPACEs is a collaborative, citizen science research project investigating sensory processing differences between autistic people and the non-autistic population, with the aim of understanding how this affects the daily lives of autistic people. 

The research centres around a web-based platform that has been co-created by an autistic community, in collaboration with The Alan Turing Institute and Austistica. As a large majority of previous research on sensory processing and autism has not genuinely empowered autistic people throughout the research process, the AutSPACEs platform instead embeds the lived experience of autistic people in the heart of the project.

The presentation session will demonstrate the platform's functionality, and talk through the purpose, design, and management of the AutSPACEs project. By design, this project follows Open Science principles within a "Participatory Science" framework. The presentation, and project itself, aims to demonstrate how research is better served by the active inclusion of autistic communities so that it may better represent the priorities, needs, and concerns of autistic individuals.

This makes the 2022 Autistica Festival the perfect place to showcase the AutSPACEs platform, and give attendees the opportunity to provide feedback and be further involved in the project, so that it represents their priorities, meets their needs, and addresses their concerns.

With this presentation we hope to showcase a new resource for autistic people, advocate for the importance of autistic inclusion in research to other autism researchers, and provide an opportunity for autistic attendees to be part of an exciting research project.

#### Lay person abstract co-working (300 words)
Approximately 90% of autistic people experience everyday sensory information (sound, smell, sight, and touch) differently than non-autistic people. Lights may seem brighter, sounds louder, and daily spaces such as schools, hospitals, and public transport can become overwhelming. However, it is not well understood what causes these differences, or what can be implemented at a society-wide level to make the world easier to experience for autistic people. 

The AutSPACEs project is building a platform where autistic people can share stories, strategies, and recommendations with other autistic people and researchers. The aim is for the platform to inform policy changes that will make public spaces more accessible. We are building this as a community of researchers, developers, autistic people and supporters. Autistic people in this project are not just research subjects, they are co-creators, decision makers, and leaders. AutSPACEs is built by, and for, autistic people.


We will present how the platform works, how to use it, and then talk through the purpose, design, and management of the AutSPACEs project. The project shares our work publically so that it can be of benefit to more people, and we welcome anyone into our community, as long as they follow our values. We emphasize values of "openess" and "participation" to create a supportive community that builds the AutSPACEs project in a way that protects and respects autistic people. 

This makes the 2022 Autistica Festival the perfect place to showcase the AutSPACEs platform, and gives members the opportunity to give feedback and to be involved in the project, so that it represents your priorities, meets your needs, and addresses your concerns. We will showcase a new resource for autistic people, advocate for the importance of autistic inclusion in research, and provide an opportunity for autistic people to be part of an exciting project.

### Please provide a statement on how your research contributes to autistic people living happier, healthier, longer lives
We envision AutSPACEs contributing positively to autistic people lives in multiple ways. The platform will give autistic people a safe, inclusive space to share ideas and strategies, it will educate non-autistic people about autistic peopleâ€™s lived experience and thereby reduce stigma and misunderstandings, and it will inform changes to public spaces and protocols for the management of those spaces so that they are more suitable for a diverse range of autistic people. The research process has meticulously centred autistic people and their priorities, and we will share and advocate for more empowering research by creating frameworks and disseminating findings. Our open science approach means that the resources we create, including code, research protocols, moderation guidelines and design systems will be available for other researchers meaning we can have impact beyond a single study. Finally, we have extensive testimony from autistic participants that they have found their involvement in AutSPACEs empowering.

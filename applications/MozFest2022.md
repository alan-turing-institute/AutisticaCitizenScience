# MozFest 2022

Application to present in The Neurodiversity and Wellbeing Space

## Description (250 words)
AutSPACEs is a community-led citizen science project to investigate how sensory processing differences affect the ways autistic people navigate the world. 
The platform is designed for autistic individuals and their supporters to share their experiences of the world so that the autistic community, allies, and researchers can understand the relationship between sensory processing and autism. 
This session will discuss the ways in which open source technologies can be used to support the development of a citizen science project in a way that prioritizes the wellbeing and empowerment of its neurodiverse community.

5 members of the AutSPACEs community will run a discussion session centring around diverse inclusion and empowerment. 
We will begin by giving an overview of AutSPACEs, and then we will each present on an area of the project we have been working on. 
We will then facilitate a series of discussions based on the following prompts:
  
* What is *genuine* empowerment?
* How can existing Open Source tools be used to support inclusive co-created projects?
* What considerations need to be made to ensure that Open Source projects maintain the safety, privacy, and wellbeing of neurodiverse communities? 
* How do we create a welcoming, inclusive online space for neurodiverse people?
* How can we develop infrastructure that open source platforms and their content are used in ways that the communities on the platforms would wish it to be used? 
* What needs to be done to support informed consent and data ownership within neurodiverse communities interacting in online spaces? 

## What is the goal and/or outcome of your session? (150 words)

We hope to share and learn methods and techniques of participatory research and co-design and advocate for neurodiverse inclusion and accessibility. 
We also hope to foster a productive discussion around inclusive online spaces and empowering research. 
As this session will be co-run by a diverse group of professional researchers, citizen scientists, and coders, we will model participatory practices, and demonstrate the value of working collaboratively and equitably.
We want to share how we have managed this project to be inclusive and empowering, and lessons learnt from creating an open-source project designed by, and for, autistic people. This includes sharing strategies for effective community management, and design ideas/principles for creating a safe and accessible online space, which maintains privacy and agency while being committed to open research.
We are excited to learn and grow by engaging with the ideas, knowledge, and experiences of the MozFest community.

## Why did you choose that space? How does your session align with the space description? (150 words)

Creating neurodiverse wellbeing is core to the AutSPACEs project and at the heart of our community. 
We are dedicated to improving the wellbeing of autistic people, and this is reflected in multiple dimensions of the project: empowering autistic people throughout the research process; creating an online space which is designed to be inclusive and accessible to individuals across the autistic constellation, and working towards research outputs which have a positive impact according to autistic people’s priorities.
We welcome MozFest’s dedicated space to neurodiversity. 
It is hugely exciting to have the opportunity to be part of a wider conversation about neurodiverse wellbeing, and to engage with a community hoping to change online norms to support neurodiverse people. The MozFest values of openness and collaboration, along with a shared desire to improve the wellbeing of neurodiverse people, makes this an ideal space for our session.

## How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3? (150 words)

We will structure the session so that 5 members from our community (~6 minutes each) present a piece they’ve developed for the project. 
We plan to have 3 targeted discussion sections where participants engage. If there are low numbers of attendance, we can hold everyone in the same online space and support a discussion with the whole group. 
If a larger number of participants attend, we will structure “breakout groups” and have our community members supporting the discussion.
We will support accessibility for a neurodiverse group by 1) a “calm room” on Zoom where anyone can go at any time for a break from the session; 2) “type” and “talk” contribution options (with a notetaker) 3) supporting the session with a code of conduct designed to facilitate inclusive, respectful interaction. The AutSPACEs team has extensive experience facilitating neurodiverse groups, and we will tailor our support for individuals as needed.

## What happens after MozFest? We're hoping that many efforts and discussions will continue after MozFest. Share any ideas you already have for how to continue the work from your session. (150 words)

We’d be delighted to continue dialogue from the session and offer support/onboarding for those interested in joining our community or using any of our resources and techniques. 
We commit to actively supporting individuals to take part to ensure the project is accessible. 
We are excited and open to opportunities for future collaboration.
We will (with participants’ permission) take notes on an open document, which we will publish on our GitHub repository, so that the learning is openly available, can be shared with the AutSPACEs community, and can be incorporated into future research. 
The co-design of the AutSPACEs platform is ongoing, with many opportunities for collaboration throughout the research cycle. 
AutSPACEs is open to all, and attendees will be warmly invited to join further discussions via. a range of routes, including regular, public meet-up sessions. 
We are also able to support others in neurodiverse inclusion.

## Biography 

The AutSPACEs community is a neurodiverse group of professional scientists, citizen scientists, open source contributors and coders working together to create inclusive autism research. 
We are supported by The Alan Turing Institute and Autistica.
Between us, we have a whole range of skills, areas of expertise, and life experiences. 
This is a collective rather than an individual biography, because not everyone in the AutSPACEs community will be at MozFest, but we have all contributed to the work that will be shared.

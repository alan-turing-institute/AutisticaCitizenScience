# Personas and Pathways

A persona is a description of an imaginary person, based on real-world observations and understandings of current or future users. 
- Persona creation tools help teams to develop a common understanding of their users. 
- Then, we can create an empathetic pathway for them to engage with the project

Who are the people you most need to work with? Who is missing? 
- Demographic information: Name, age, gender, accessibility requirements
- Characteristics: Skills, level of knowledge, experience
- Behaviors & belief: Needs, motivations, barriers, preferred channels
- Challenges & goals: What they want to achieve, what they can offer (skill, time etc)

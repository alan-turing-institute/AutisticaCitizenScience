# Mountain of Engagement

**Purpose:** To identify how people engage with your work and how the best forms of engagement can help improve others.

**Outcome(s):** A heatmap of participation in your community, organization, or project, and a clear understanding of what works that can be used to iterate and improve all forms of participation.

**Process:** Where am I now? → Where do I want it to be? → Complete template → Review with your mentor

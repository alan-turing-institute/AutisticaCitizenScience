# Platform Designs

In this folder, you will find key information about the Design of the platform. 

## Where to start. 
You can get started by reading the [design-introduction.md](design-introduction.md) file which gives an overview of what design is, the design process AutSPACEs uses, and definitions for the design terminology that is used. 

## Folder Structure 

### [ARCHIVE-fujitsu](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/ARCHIVE-fujitsu) 
This folder contains design information from the Fujitsu prototypes of the platform. Many of these documents are no longer used but still important. 

### [design-architecture](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-architecture) 
The design-architecture folder contains information relating to how the pages of the platform fit together and how someone can navigate the platform. 

### [design-brief](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-brief)
This folder contains the design briefs for the platform. 

### [design-changes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-changes) 
This folder contains change logs or information relating to changes across designs. 

### [design-content](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-content) 
This folder contains copy, assets, and other content related material for the platform.

### [design-process](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-process) 
This folder contains information about the process we are following to design the AutSPACEs platform.

### [design-requirements](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-requirements)
This folder contains key information on the requirements for both [the MVP](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/mvp-requirements-list.md) and [second phase platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/requirements-list.md).
This allows you to see what specific features will be needed from each page of the platform.

### [design-research](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-research)
This folder contains key information or links to all "user research" for the platform designs. 

### [design-resources](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-resources)
This folder contains and collates resources that support the design of the project. This includes curated lists, templates, design sketches, tutorials, and anything else that can be considered a "resource" when designing the various parts of the AutSPACEs project.  

### [design-system](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-system)
This folder contains information about the design system that is used in the platform.
You can find more information on what a design system is at the Adobe website [here]()

### [Wireframes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/wireframes)
*Wireframes are visual guides showing the layout and design of the platform.*
The wireframes folder contains all wireframes that have been developed for the autspaces platform. 
This includes most recent images of the MVP wireframe for the Autistica/Turing citizen science project.

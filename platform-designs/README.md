# Platform Designs

In this folder, you will find key information about the **Design** of the AutSPACEs platform. The platform's code is housed in the companion repository [/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). 

## Where to start. 

This is the Project Management repository for the AutSPACEs project. Part of the AutSPACEs project is the development of the AutSPACEs platform, however good design is not limited to just web applications, which is why this folder sits here. 

If you are new to design and UX, you can get started by reading the [design-introduction.md](design-introduction.md) file which gives an overview of what design is, the design process AutSPACEs uses, and definitions for the design terminology that is used. 

If you are returning or are a designer wanting to get involved, first read our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then familiarize yourself with the resources found in this repository. 

⚠️ A quick reminder that if you would like to work on the code or development of the AutSPACEs platform (for example implementing the design system) then the repository you're in right now will contain information on what the design changes are and what the platform will look like, however the **code** for the platform is in the [/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs) repository. 

**All contributions are wellcome!**

### [ARCHIVE-fujitsu](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/ARCHIVE-fujitsu) 
This folder contains design information from the Fujitsu prototypes of the platform. Many of these documents are no longer used but still important. 

### [design-architecture](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-architecture) 
The design-architecture folder contains information relating to how the pages of the platform fit together and how someone can navigate the platform. 

### [design-brief](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-brief)
This folder contains the design briefs for the platform. 

### [design-changes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-changes) 
This folder contains change logs or information relating to changes across designs. 

### [design-content](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-content) 
This folder contains copy, assets, and other content related material for the platform.

### [design-process](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-process) 
This folder contains information about the process we are following to design the AutSPACEs platform.

### [design-requirements](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-requirements)
This folder contains key information on the requirements for both [the MVP](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/mvp-requirements-list.md) and [second phase platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/requirements-list.md).
This allows you to see what specific features will be needed from each page of the platform.

### [design-research](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-research)
This folder contains key information or links to all "user research" for the platform designs. 

### [design-resources](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-resources)
This folder contains and collates resources that support the design of the project. This includes curated lists, templates, design sketches, tutorials, and anything else that can be considered a "resource" when designing the various parts of the AutSPACEs project.  

### [design-system](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-system)
This folder contains information about the design system that is used in the platform.
You can find more information on what a design system is at the Adobe website [here]()

### [Wireframes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/wireframes)
*Wireframes are visual guides showing the layout and design of the platform.*
The wireframes folder contains all wireframes that have been developed for the autspaces platform. 
This includes most recent images of the MVP wireframe for the Autistica/Turing citizen science project.

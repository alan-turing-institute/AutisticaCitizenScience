## Platform Designs

In this folder, you will find key information around what the platform should look like and how a user would interact with it. 

### [Requirements](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements)

This folder contains key information on the requirements for both [the MVP](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/mvp-requirements-list.md) and [second phase platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/requirements-list.md). 
This allows you to see what specific features will be needed from each page of the platform. 

*A requirement is a specification of a need or want. Sets of requirements are used to capture the information needed to design, build and test a process, service, product or system.*

### [Wireframes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/wireframes)

This folder contains resources and links to the designs for the citizen science platform. 
This includes most recent images of the MVP wireframe for the Autistica/Turing citizen science project. 

All wireframes are created in [figma]](https://www.figma.com/file/HxqTSdeyAUNMualnBV0PET/Autspace-(WIP)?node-id=172%3A641).

*Wireframes are visual guides showing the layout and design of the platform.* 

### [User Flow](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/user-flow)

In this folder you will find a diagram which explains the journey of how a user would interact with the platform. This is called the "information architecture" of the website and explains how the wireframes all link together on the platform.

*A user flow is a visual representation, either written out or made digitally, of the many avenues that can be taken when using an app or website.*

### [User Experience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/573) 

This links to Issue [#573](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/573) which outlines the process of defining and building the User Experience of the platform.

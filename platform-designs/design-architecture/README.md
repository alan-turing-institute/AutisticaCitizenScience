# Design Architecture 

## Information Architecture

Information Architecture(IA) is a diagram which shows the journey of how a user would interact with the platform. 

It's useful for oulining the relationship between pages on the AutSPACEs platform and to review if the features on each page correctly address user needs. 

IA focuses on two elements: **where a user is** and **where to find information a user needs**. 

### How to read an IA Diagram
* The diagram reads as a hierarchy from top to bottom with each layer starting with a "parent" element that has corresponding "child" elements.

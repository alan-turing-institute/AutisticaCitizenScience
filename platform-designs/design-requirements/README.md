# Design Requirements 

This folder contains key information on the requirements for both [the MVP](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/mvp-requirements-list.md) and [second phase platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/platform-requirements/requirements-list.md).

It captures many of the important features for accessibility and usability of the platform.

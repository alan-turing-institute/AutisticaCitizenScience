# AutSPACEs Requirements List

This is a requirement list which can be used to see the basic structure of the platform. 

This file lists every page/page-flow of the AutSPACEs platform which has to be built for the platform to be functional, along with a list of desired features on each page. These will eventually be turned into issues on the main repository. For now we are working on a simplified MVP version of the platform.  
It also includes some additional features to be used throughout the platform.  

This list can be used to 

*The content is based on preferences and needs emerging from the Autistic/Turing Citizen Science community in discussion sessions and co-working sesssions. 
You can view all the gathered recommendations from the community in the [community-recommendations folder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations) of the project management reepository.

A complete board of issues is available on the AutSPACEs issues board on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/w2XLjB9g/issues).
Issues will be migrated gradually as the platform progresses, to make sure priority milestones are met and the supporting platform infrastructure is in place.

A wireframe mockup of the platform is is available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/HxqTSdeyAUNMualnBV0PET/Autspace-(WIP)?node-id=1%3A111). The MVP pages are those prefaced by "simplified".

### Moderation flow

The moderation process is currently being co-created by the autistic/turing citizen science community. 
In the meantime, it would be useful to have a basic moderation flow:

* Sign-in flow adapted for moderators
* With sign access to a moderation page:
	* All experiences with permission to publicly share are automatically fed into this page.
	* User can view an experience and assess it anonymously 
	* User can publish experience if appropriate

*General design features* 

### Additional design considerations

* autistic people can be overwhelmed by too much information on one page: clear, clean, logical and sequential design. 
* simple words, no metaphors 
* step-by-steps and diagrams
* must be accessible to people with diverse needs (incorporate Chris’ work)
* not too high contrast (too bright a screen can cause pain to some autistic people) (A)
* adapts to different screen sizes well (phone, website, ipad) (AP)
* option to ask real people for help
* must contain voice-to-text and screen reader capabilities  
* make motivation salient
* no word limits/counts (AP)
* no bewildering alerts or prompts that may provoke anxiety
* no time countdowns  
* Help and guidance options

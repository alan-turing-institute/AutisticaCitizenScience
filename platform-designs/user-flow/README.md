# User Flow 

To illustrate how the platform will work and how a user would navigate through it, we have created a user flow. 

This can be seen in [this image](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/user-flow/user-flow.png).

Here it shows us key elements of how each page links together and how a user would interact with the platform.

# Wireframes

In this folder you will find the wireframes for the platform. 
We have used a platform called [figma](figma.com) to produce our wireframes and images of each page can be found here.

To understand how each page fits in the the platform, the user flow has been mapped out and can be found in the user flow folder in platform designs. 

## How to Use the Wireframes

These wireframes are for the AutSPACEs platform, you can find the code and development work for the platform by visiting the [AutSPACEs repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs) where you will find more information about how the platform is built and where these wireframes have been implemented.

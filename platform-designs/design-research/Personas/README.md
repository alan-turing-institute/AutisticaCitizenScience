# AutSPACEs Persona README 

## What is a Persona
- User personas are fictional users that represent the needs of user groups. 
- Identifying user personas can help us better understand the needs and pain points of users.
- You can read more information on Personas at the Adobe website [here](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/)

## AutSPACEs Personas
- For AutSPACEs, we have identified 5 user groups: **austistic users, developers, researchers, non-autistic users**,and **decision makers**. 
- These user groups have allowed us to develop 5 Personas:
    - Ali
    - Cameron
    - Kendall
    - August
    - Jesse

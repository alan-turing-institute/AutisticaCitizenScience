# Wireframe Resources

Simply secure has a great intro to wireframing: https://simplysecure.org/blog/wireframing-intro

A few good online wireframing tools:
- [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/freehand) - very simple to use (just like drawing) and good for collaboration
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - A a few more features and prebuilt templates
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - more sophisticate option, would be good for working with designers.

# Translations in Django

# Python configuration


##### settings.py
``` python

from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy 

# Set up a list of languages to be supported
LANGUAGES = (
    ('en', _('English')),
    ('fr', _('French')),
)

# If the browser doesn't send us a locale, use this:
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

# Configure the base dir for the locale path
LOCALE_PATHS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'locale'),
)

```

Ensure that:

- `django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`
- `django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware`
- `django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`

are in the `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` dict.

# How to generate new translations

Ensure the language code you use is in the language configuration as above.

You must also ensure it is a valid as per [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

Run the command: `python manage.py makemessages -l '<Country Code>'`

This creates the `.po` file which can be found in `locale/<Country Code>/LOCALE_MESSAGES/django.po`

It also conveniently generates translation messages it finds in templates and classes - ready for the msgstr to be populated.

# How to compile translations

Translations need to be compiled before Django can utilise them.

This is done by running the following command:

`python manage.py compilemessages`

Which generates a `.mo` binary file in the same location as the `.po`.

# How to make use of the translations

## In a django template file

```
{% raw %}
<h1>{% trans 'Welcome' %}</h1>
{% endraw %}
```


## In the view
... *pending* ...


# How to Contribute to Translations

The section will detail how the community can get involved with adding translations.

## The translation files

The files which include the translations which Django uses are at:
`project_root/locale`

| Language | locale code | File                     |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| English  | en          | en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po |
| French   | fr          | fr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po |
| ...      |             |                          |

## How the files look

Each section within the `.po` file looks like this:

<img width="390" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3026030/84674536-f9a04300-af22-11ea-8788-7c5bda66a693.png">

The msgid is the tag, which the Django templating language uses to load the translations in depending on the users Locale setting; and the comment above shows the location of the translations use - file path and line number.

Where this is a single word, the msgid matches the word needing the translation - however in the event that this is a phrase the msgid represents the marker for the translations' placement. To find the phrase needed to be translated, you can look in the other language files (for example English) to find the orignal phrase.

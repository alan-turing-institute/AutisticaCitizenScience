## Prototypes and Wireframes

The designs for the platform are in two forms, prototypes and wireframes.

### Prototypes

This folder will contain links to versions of working prototypes of the platform when they are complete.

*Prototypes are early working versions of the platform to demonstrate and test designs*

Currently, work on building a prototype is taking place in a separate repository, where all the code can be accessed:

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype

### Wireframes

This folder contains resources and links to the designs for the citizen science platform. This includes a link to the most recent wireframe created for the Autistica/Turing citizen science project, as well as resources and documentation.

*Wireframes are visual guides showing the layout and design of the platform.* 

The latest version of the wireframe along with design decisions and materials can be viewed on axshare.com:

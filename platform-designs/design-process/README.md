# Design Process

This folder contains content (e.g. presentations, meeting summary notes, images etc) that we have generated throughout the Design Process. The Design Process is used to understand, empathise, define, ideate, prototype, and test designs for the AutSPACEs platform. 

Our [Design Introduction](/platform-designs/design-introduction.md) file gives an overview of the specific process we are following while designing AutSPACEs, and this Issue [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/573) captures the process and discussion of implementing the UX design process. 

It is core to our Community Values that we work openly and with transparency. As a result, this folder will be a "work in progress" and content wil be added as we move throughout the Design Process.

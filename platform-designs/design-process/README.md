# Design Process

This folder contains content (e.g. presentations, meeting summary notes, images etc) that we have generated throughout the Design Process. 

Our Design Introduction file gives an overview of the specific process we are following while designing AutSPACEs, however more specific information will be put in here. 

It is core to our Community Values that we work openly and with transparency. As a result, this folder will be a "work in progress" and content wil be added as we move throughout the Design Process.

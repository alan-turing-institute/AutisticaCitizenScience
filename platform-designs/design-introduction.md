# Introduction into the AutSPACEs Design

**“Design”** covers everything from 
- Visual Design (what it looks like)
- Interaction Design (how users interact with it)
- System Design (how the pages or components fit together)
- Interface Design (how it responses to the user)

These design types fall into the category of **“User Experience Design” (UX)**. UX is everything that affects the experience and use of a digital product. We will refer to the UX design of the platform throughout this folder. 
You can read more about UX at Adobe’s website [here](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/career-tips/what-is-ux-design/).  


## The Design Process 
There are many different design processes you can follow when developing a project. We are following a specific UX Design Process for AutSPACE called "Design Thinking". 
- We chose this process because it aligns with our focus on co-creation. Our community believes in building AutSPACEs, so that there is __nothing for us, without us__. This means that the design of the platform (and all its features) are built by, for, and with autistic individuals.

8/21/2019 15:19:38,Yes,"I would like to learn how to improve fire safety advice and technology such as smoke alarms, to better protect people with autism from fire and its effects.  For example, would a different alarm noise be better in some cases, or a flashing light instead of the sound?  Can buildings have better signage or layout to improve chances of safe escape from a fire?  Where a significant fire risk exists, would a sprinkler or water mist system be appropriate or inappropriate in some cases, dependent upon the autistic individual who lives in the property?",I am a parent/ guardian of someone autistic,Yes

What intrigued you about the project?
What's your relationship/connection to autism or the project's issues?
What do you expect from this session?
Do you require any additional support?
What's your preferred style of working within a group? Written, verbal, images? - Catering to accessibility
Incorporate a quiet space if it gets too much
Do people have mobility impairments? Be prepared for this.
No more than 2-3 questions per turn (break up session) - if people have extra questions or suggestions put in a comment box so they can still be responded to
In case people have difficulties, e.g. anxiety, have someone to assist/make sure they get included.
Make clear that people can't make their own recordings.
Booklet or material about what to expect.",I am autistic,Yes

9/24/2019 14:15:53,Yes,"I am concerned about the difficulties travelling in / navigating confined spaces like tube trains and lifts. On 17 th September l attended a council meeting in a new mixed use building that has been passed as finished yet the lift l exited from the second floor to ground level had ply board fascias next to the metal control panel. There was lots of striped sticky tape holding the boards in place and l felt very uncomfortable.  Could they collapse and fall in on me or if there was an electric spark would they ignite. Where was the panic button. Nowhere in plain sight. I’m travelling in a FIRE BOX. I was shaking inside the whole journey down. I complained at the reception desk as l signed out, asking hey they didn’t see it as a priority to finish it and have emergency signage clearly visible. I asked them to log the complaint and emailed my council too. I attended a meeting on 23 rd. The lift is finished. I feel my feelings were validated.","I am autistic, I am a parent/ guardian of someone autistic, I know someone who is autistic",Yes

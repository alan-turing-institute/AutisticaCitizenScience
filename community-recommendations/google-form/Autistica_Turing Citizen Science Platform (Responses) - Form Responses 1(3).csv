For example, would a different alarm noise be better in some cases, or a flashing light instead of the sound?  Can buildings have better signage or layout to improve chances of safe escape from a fire?

What intrigued you about the project?
What's your relationship/connection to autism or the project's issues?
What do you expect from this session?
Do you require any additional support?
What's your preferred style of working within a group? Written, verbal, images? - Catering to accessibility
Incorporate a quiet space if it gets too much
Do people have mobility impairments? Be prepared for this.
No more than 2-3 questions per turn (break up session) - if people have extra questions or suggestions put in a comment box so they can still be responded to
In case people have difficulties, e.g. anxiety, have someone to assist/make sure they get included.
Make clear that people can't make their own recordings.

9/24/2019 14:15:53,Yes,"I am concerned about the difficulties travelling in / navigating confined spaces like tube trains and lifts. In September l attended a council meeting in a new mixed use building that has been passed as finished yet the lift l exited from the second floor to ground level had ply board fascias next to the metal control panel. There was lots of striped sticky tape holding the boards in place and l felt very uncomfortable.  Could they collapse and fall in on me or if there was an electric spark would they ignite. Where was the panic button. Nowhere in plain sight. I’m travelling in a FIRE BOX. I was shaking inside the whole journey down. I complained at the reception desk as l signed out, asking hey they didn’t see it as a priority to finish it and have emergency signage clearly visible. I asked them to log the complaint and emailed my council too. I attended a meeting. The lift is finished. I feel my feelings were validated.","I am autistic, I am a parent/ guardian of someone autistic, I know someone who is autistic",Yes

12/21/2019 19:22:40,Yes,"On Friday l was called to a council photo shoot as part of a Disabled group coproducing ruthless inclusion for residents in a new Town Hall. I knew l would be stood beside skips, barriers and various builders materials yet the reality was disorientating. I have just started walking with a stick because my arthritis in my right hip is too painful to walk unaided. I felt unstable already but even more so transferring from sitting under harsh tube lighting inside a builders office to being lined up by the photographer outside for the shots. I wrongly assumed someone had briefed him about my  sensitivities towards flash.  Two of our group are blind so it affects them less ( not to minimise their need to be less exposed to dramatic changes in their ambient environment ). I felt very shaky as the flash went off continuously. He apologised yet made no adjustments whatsoever when l raised my sensitivity.  I’ve learned from this experience to always mention my barriers, needs and to insist that they are considered before asking me to participate in events like this.

12/21/2019 19:34:41,Yes,"When l was travelling on a South Western train to Canterbury from St Pancras l found the fact that the whole train had no markings to define which was first class and which one was economy very disorienting. I almost didn’t board. I assumed l was not allowed to get on it. I had to ask a fellow passenger if my ticket was ok to use on it. On the return journey two days later l narrowly avoided tripping over a very tiny metal lip at the step down by the automatic exit / entry doors. It’s a peculiar feature on these trains that l have never encountered before. I have no idea how visually impaired clients deal with it. You do not always get a mind the gap warning on overground trains like you do on the tube. Why on earth isn’t it flush like on other train lines. I found myself breathing quite shakily for the next five minutes or so. It influenced me to do a different route home on the tube that increased my journey time, making me more tired. I’ve learned from this experience to be more vigilant about exit points. ","I am autistic, I am a parent/ guardian of someone autistic, I know someone who is autistic",Yes
12/21/2019 19:50:11,Yes,"I was invited to attend the recently completed Westminster City Hall for a Equality and Diversity day in my capacity as a Human book. Despite using Google images /maps prior to travel l found their lobby was identical to two other buildings on the same road with no outside or visible signage to indicate it was the town hall. Upon entry I found two receptionists who were both occupied. One with a visitor being verified for security, the other talking to other staff about their computer terminal being down. Neither acknowledged my presence with a polite nod or diverted from their conversation when l asked politely if was in the right place and where could l sign in. The computer lady shooed me over to the First Lady who just ignored me. Eventually she lifted her head and told me to sit on chairs across the lobby with a vast amount of people pushing past me at 9 am to go through the same security barriers l wanted to use. I politely refused to do that announcing my Autism, my anxiety and that l knew where l needed to be on 19 th floor. Could they kindly call my hosts, ( their employers! )as l did not want to be late. They assisted two other people before eventually doing that. I was agitated, angry and had to ask for assistance at the lift bank as we did not get a prod pass to use them. The Council received my feedback as part of the event. I am assured they will use digital check ins as part of better inclusion.

If you can see it, hear it, and even read it in a kind of prompted sense, which technology is slowly recognising, then it can improve the chances one has with taking in a subject.

A: depends on density of where you are (urban or rural) but generally a choice of 5 should be enough without being overwhelming.

Q: If the platform were to provide a feature of showing you locations of nearby sanctuaries/safe spaces, how would you like to see these presented to you? e.g. pins on a map, a list or other. 

A: My personal preference is on a map but many people do not work well with geo-spatial information so a list should also be available.","I am autistic, I am a parent/ guardian of someone autistic, Someone in my family is autistic, I know someone who is autistic",Yes

A: I would expect to find both: i) experiences plotted on a map and ii) searchable by keyword, e.g. 'bus travel'.  To many people the location of someone else's experience will be relevant and helpful, but to others it won't be meaningful.  Classifying by the emotion felt would be another useful way of accessing others' experiences.","I am autistic, I am a parent/ guardian of someone autistic, Someone in my family is autistic, I know someone who is autistic",Yes

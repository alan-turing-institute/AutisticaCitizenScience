# Research Paper Ideas 

### General Themes

* Moderation
	* Participatory -creation
	* Problems of neurotypical normativity
	* Building on double empathy problem 

 * Qualitative data analysis
 	* How to gather and analyse valid qualitative data from neurodiverse groups (e.g. not accidentally illiciting consent/affirmation)
 	* Working with potentially vulnerable populations
 	* Gathering qualitative date from populations often excluded from research (or spoken on behalf)

### Rough notes

Problem: how do you measure what metrics are missing when they are applied?
Are we tracking just what's comparable instead of what's most relevant/important.  
	Solution: use some of the standard measures, e.g. surveys, criterium, which can easily become quaitifed (there may be a battery of tests) 
	Compare to free discussions groups on the theme the metrics are being used to address - if something is both apposite to the topic and unrefernced, 
	also tracks quantifiably undifferntiatable differences

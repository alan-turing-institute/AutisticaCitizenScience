# Coders Collaboration 

### 14/03/2021

## Notes

#### GSOC

* Proposal - we ask the GSOC students to build a project on Open Humans and try to deploy it. 
* We also ask them to look through the requirements list on the AutSPACEs repo and choose something they would like to work on over summer and make some suggestions. 
* If we don't get anyone of a high enough standard we don't take anyone on.
* We continue to work on building the platform, and adapt the summer plans on the basis of where we reach by April. 

#### What are the confusing aspects of the project? 

* Multiple repos - unclear how they link up
* Make explicit the link between the project and open humans
* UX design will need a lot of work and attention - can be tricky to do with diverse group

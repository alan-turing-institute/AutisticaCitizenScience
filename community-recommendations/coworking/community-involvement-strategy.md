# Community Involvement Strategy 

These are notes from co-working sessions, and include comments from the focus groups which are recommendations for commnuity involvement. 

## Define who is already involved (categories)

 * Individual volunteers
 * Autistica's insight group
 * Autism researchers
 * Other academics/researchers/activists
 * Representatives from institutions/organisations
 * Autistica
 * Fujitsu - individuals
 * The Turing
* Open humans
* CRI

## Possible New Channels of engagement 
 * Autistica - more thorough involvement 
 * NAS
 * Autism activism groups (with a priority of groups outside of London)
 * POC/intersectionality groups
 * University groups
 * Schools
 * Autistica comms network (e.g.  via. Twitter)
 * Researchers network (Twitter and networks)
 * Turing social media networks?
 * Participants' social networks 
 * Open Human's network
 * Mainstream Media
 * Corporate partners? (Perhaps we could get larger companies to publically back the project, TFL would be a great one due to environmental interaction element)
 * Influencers/Celebrities?
 * Civil service in general
 * DDAT in particular
     * contact WhatsApp groups - put out a call for help and especially autistic collaborators
     * Also disability networks in government - gov can pay people for upskilling?
 
## Where/on what we need input (design, user testing, documentation feedback etc.)

 * Comms and community engagement
 * Design 
 * Development
 * User testing
 * Co-design
 * Reviewing work (inc. dev work, videos, documentation)
 * Diversity and inclusion
 * Interpretation of data
 * Ensuring the research questions are tailored to the community and are relevant (much of this has been done via. The James Lind Alliance to choose topic of research - more work needs to be done on the specific phrasing of the question and how we chunk it up - this is a platform feature: we need this as part of user testing)
 * Maintenance - planning and support. 
 
## Who we need to ask

 * Autistic people 
     * [(A d): “I’m autistic so I’ve got an awful lot of experience which I hope to contribute to the group”](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/focus-groups/20190918_summary-18-September-2019.md#sharing-expertise-and-personal-perspective).

 * Autistic people with complex needs
 * Autistic people who are non-verbal:

## Specific asks
* Review qs - answer specific questions and watch video (CL) - co-design - rephrase 

## How we use/record the feedback
 * We need to follow the protocols for which we have ethics approval

## Inclusivity and accessibility checks

#### Strand 1- Diversity

* Are our current networks adequately able to capture the full range of diversity within the autistic community? 

* If not, how do we engage these audiences to ensure they have the opportunity to participate in the project? What additional networks and channels can be leveraged (other charities, pressure groups, social media channels, forums). 

* Is our approach London centric? Do we need to consider how to reach a more diverse geographic networks?

* What are the hard to reach areas? How can we reach these areas? (community engagement, social media engagement etc).

* What do we know about our current network? Does it trend towards particular background, locality, race, gender, socio-economic or stands of neurodiversity? Do we know, how do we know, how do we change it?

* Perhaps we could do some stakeholder mapping?

#### Strand 2- Pathways to engagement

* Do we think the current participatory environment is truly inclusionary? 
* Where and how do we think it can be improved? 
* Onboarding etc? 
    * I think we should try to think this through using the ‘5 stages’ Malvika’s slide set-out which is really good.

* How can we cater for the disparate needs, skills and availability of participators. Is our current approach too generic and cookie-cutter (ie. Sign-up, take part in user testing, focus groups etc)? Does this approach work for most? · What other routes are there for members to participate representing the likely future shift in the projects priorities? Publicity, social media advocacy/comms/dissemination as well as wider research.

* Is there value of community members taking a more passive role, particularly as we begin the rollout and we build up a community of members, perhaps as supporters?

* Is there a route for people to move up the stages of participation? Another question is what if people want to do less, not more or want to do something outside of our framework? The overarching question for me is are our systems flexible and inclusive enough to respond to peoples needs?

* We need to talk about Github. Is it really the place to run a participatory people for non-neurodiversity people off? Is it prohibitively off-putting? What are the alternatives?

### Strand 3- Path to delivery (rollout)

* We want to ensure we capture as wider and diverse range of responses as possible to aid the study. To do this we need a really effective dissemination approach to autistic networks. As a result Strands 1 and 3 go really closely in hand as we need to have reach across the community. To an extent it also links into strand 2.

* Success will also be predicated on a successful comms/dissemination campaign. However I think this is a slightly different piece of work then the two proceeding strands.

### Next Steps (what I want to find out)

* Understanding where our gaps are asking if we are truly inclusive.

* Any reading on participatory projects with a particular focus on engaging ‘harder-to-reach areas (particularly lower socio-economic’?

* Undertaking stakeholder and dissemination channel mapping. Who should be involved that isn’t, how do we reach them, what areas are not currently being exploited etc?

## Opportunities for growth
  * 'Hard to reach' people in the autistic community

# Participatory Science for mitigating Epistemic Injustice

### Central philosophical terms and concepts

1. "Testimonial injustice", wherein a speaker receives an unfair deficit of credibility from a hearer owing to prejudice on the hearer's part. 
2. (https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001/acprof-9780198237907-chapter-7)

2. "Hermeneutic injustice", wherein someone has a significant area of their social experience obscured from understanding owing to prejudicial flaws in shared resources for social interpretation. 
3. (https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001/acprof-9780198237907-chapter-8)

3. Miranda Fricker" "Like the virtue of testimonial justice, this virtue is a hybrid ethical-intellectual virtue."" 
4. (https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001/acprof-9780198237907-chapter-8) - ethical and moral implications intertwined (it is a virtue to **correct intellectual errors or lacunae** which have **negative effects on human beings**). 
(In this paper we are looking at the particular case in which both aspects hold, hence the hybrid - we are not looking at cases of a)truths which have adverse effects on human beings b)untruths which have neutral or positive effects on human beings). 

5. 'Looping Effects' (Hacking): wherein [the subjects of study] ('human kinds') [respond to scientific notions in the social sciences], changing the nature of that subject. This is then fed back into the scientific study, once again affecting the 'human kinds' who are studied, perpetuating the process.

### Disentangling arguments - fundamentals

1: There is a moral dimension to the social sciences because the study of 'human kinds' affects human beings, who have moral status. (taken as axiomatic)
> What is meant by, "taken as axiomatic?" 
> Are you defining the social sciences as Hacking does?

2: The social sciences are also engaged in knowledge-seeking: seeking to make true propositions about the world. (taken as axiomatic)

3: We can identify a number of possible effects the social sciences might have on the 'human kinds' studied:
* relation to self, self-understanding, self-perception
* interpersonal dynamics (how others view and treat "human kinds", and how this unfolds interdynamic processes/set of relationships)
* treatment by professionals - doctors, diagnosticians, social care providers etc.
* treatment by society - e.g. discriminataion, inadequate adaptation, service provision, etc.

4: How social sciences progress can be affected by:
* The social sciences' own output (e.g. findings being further entrenched by being fed back into subsequent investigations at various stages)
* The changes to the "human kinds" studied due to the output of findings (e.g. concur, internalise, resist - changing behaviour, etc.)

5: The social sciences have a number of stages where changes may occur:
* What starting assumptions and categories are used to formulate research questions
* What specific questions are focussed on/investigated
* What sample/dataset is used for the investigation
* What metrics are taken/how the data is gathered
* Analysis 
* Interpretation of analysis
* Findings themselves
* Dissemination of findings
* Levels of critique
* How rigid or flexible any of these aspects are 
* Who is involved in any of these stages

6: (5. relates to 3. and 4., in that changes in the stages may effect outcomes and inputs of 3. and 4.)
> This clarification is really useful!

7: as a result of 6.; the outputs of the social sciences are also causes of change - they create new conditions for investigation - in terms of
* the world being investigated (the "human kinds") - *Hacking Looping Effects*
* who gets to take part in social science investigations and in what capacity - affecting *testimonial injustice* 
* the instruments of investigation (the social sciences themselves and what concepts etc. are available) - affecting *hermeneutical injustice*
* all of these can conditions can in principle affect the others.
> Just to be clear: has the above been a reconstruction of Hacking's argument for your own clarity?
> These are my attempts to delineate Fricker's subtypes of epistemic injustice and Hacking's account

8. "Stereotype": an assumption about  group based on prior judgement - thoughts about members of a group; "prejudice": attitudes or feelings about group; 
	* Scientific outputs and methods are vulnerable to the effects of stereotypes and prejudice, leading to both immoral consequences and inaccurate methods and conclusions.
	* Science outputs and methods ~~can also~~ produce and can reproduce prejudice and stereotypes
> The argument in our presentation is about the latter, not the former
* This has some similarity to certain scientific processes, e.g.:
	* identifying/categorising a 'human kind' according to shared characteristics; or 
	* creating diagnostic criteria on that basis
* What separates legitimate scientific catgorisations from prejudicial group formations is 
	* a)methodological soundness (i.e. are these categories and conclusions justified based on the evidence, and is the evidence appropriate) and 
	* b)moral implications (i.e. does this have negative effects on human beings?)
> Long sentence :wink: 
> eeeeek yup sorry! :sweat_smile: 

### Arguments r.e. participatory science

#### Remedy against researcher bias - (increased scientific validity)

* Researchers may be biased due to being influenced by society and/or scientific stereotypes
* Participatory science can act as a remedial force against cognitive biases such as othering and over-generalisation, because by including individuals with a more complete understanding from their lived experience.
> I don't think we should speak of "*researcher* bias" -- the claim is much bolder: there is a stereotype perpetuated by science at large because of its methods and, well, nature. Participatory science is a method that mitigates the risks outlined by Fricker and entailed by Hacking.
> - I agree, Ismael - if anything, the capacity for human minds to be biased aggregates into systemic bias (aand by more complex means), but this is probably uneccessarily obfuscating. 

#### Increased scientific validity

* Autistic people have access to more information - 'lived experience', as a result of being autistic
* Participatory science enables this information to be accessed, thereby allowing for more complete findings.
> This is a big claim and beyond -- wait for it! -- the scope of our presentation
>  fair :) :100: - just laying it out there to extract it from the argument so it doesn't get tangled up in there

#### Remedy against testimonial injustice

* Scientists and scientific research is socially privilieged as a provider of credible truth
* Autistic people are often not seen as credible providers of truth due to social prejudice
* By involving autistic people in scientific research:
	* their views influence scientific outputs, and thus are afforded more credibility
	* they as individuals are given platforms for dissemination and included in scientific institutions, affording them more credibility
	* involvement further breaks down the hierarchy of "knower" and "known", such that testimonial injustice breaks down:
		* autistic individuals may feel more able to assert their views to others, or they may have increasing self-confidence in the validity of their own views, due to participation (c.f. Sue example)
		* scientists may see autistic people as more credible and their views as more credible, and so be more able to incorporate them in the knowledge-seeking/making/sharing processes
		* scientific institutions themselves become more diverse, with more autistic people holding positions which afford credibility to their views
		* more widely, people become used to autistic people having positions which afford credibility, and therefore prejudice against autistic people leading to testimonial injustice is lessened
		* this includes autistic people, who may see themselves as more credible/more empowered
		* looping effects - positive cycle

#### Remedy against hermeneutic injustice
> "Remedy" is a strong word.
>  "mitigating?"

* Science provides shared resources for social interpretation
* These are likely to be biased because of existing prejudice
	* Prejudice and stereotyping are generally considered to be the product of adaptive processes that simplify an otherwise complex world so that people can devote more cognitive resources to other tasks. However, despite any cognitively adaptive function they may serve, using these mental shortcuts when making decisions about other individuals can have serious negative ramifications. (https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199828340/obo-9780199828340-0097.xml)
* including autistic people in the knowledge-seeking/making/sharing process gives opportunities for new hermeneutics to be created which are a better fit for autistic people's lived experience
* this means that in terms of self-understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and social/institution-based interactions, autistic people have better concepts and resources for understanding and communicating their experiences 
* this can become a virtuous, self-propogating circle, affecting future science

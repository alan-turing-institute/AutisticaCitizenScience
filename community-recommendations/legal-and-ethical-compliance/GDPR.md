It was created following advice from Ekaterina Harrison, a project participant, who is offering legal support, given on 19/03/2020.

### Questions to answer for GDPR

The following should be detailed in order to comply with GDPR. They also provide useful information for developers as GDPR demands privacy by design. 

#### Project overview

What is the purpose of the personal data processing?

Who is the data controller?

Who is the data processor?

#### Data

Which personal data will be processed?

Shall any of the processed data be regarded as sensitive data or data of a highly personal nature?

What are the types of data subjects?

What are the sources of personal data?

Have you considered minimisation of data collection? Will the processing help you to achieve the desired result? Could the same result be achieved without processing? Are there any ethical issues or potential discrimination with the processing? Is the processing proportional to your purpose?

Are you processing data relating to vulnerable people (imbalance of power between the controller and data subject) or children?

Are you collecting data about people in their personal or professional capacity?

What format is used to collect the data?

Are you processing structured or unstructured data?

Are you collecting data from the third parties? Do they have consent to disclose the data to you?

#### Basis for processing

What is the ground for processing (consent, legitimate interest, other)?

In case of consent, where the consent is stored? Was it informed and documented?

How the privacy notice could be found?

#### Retention and disposal

How do you store the data?

What is the retention period?

What is the process to back-up, archive and/or delete the data? Any special arrangements for business continuity or system decommissioning?

Do you need to reuse the data for other purposes or share it with the third parties?

Do you need to transfer data outside of the EU? What channels for transfer are used?

If you use cloud-computing services, do you have a contract with the cloud service provider guaranteeing the servers and backups will be in European Union or in the agreed listed country, and that personal information will be kept secure?

#### Security

Who will have access to results? Is it done on the ‘need to know’ basis?

If third parties are involved in processing have you carried out their risk assessment?

#### Data subjects

Is it possible to extract the data related to a particular data subject in a legible format?

Is it possible to delete the data related to a particular data subject upon request?

Will third parties involved in processing erase the personal data upon request?

Do you do any profiling or automated decision-making?

Arrangements to address individual rights

Right to be informed

Right of access

Right to rectification

Right to erasure/right to be forgotten

Right to object and restrict processing

Right to data portability

Rights in relation to international transfer(s)

Rights in relation to prior consultation

Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling

#### Countries involved

Where is the location of the data subjects?

Where is the location of users?

Where is the hosting location? Is it different for support and maintenance functions?

What are the international data transfer arrangements?

#### Advice on steps to ensuring legal support

* Share GDPR considerations with development team 
* Write a briefing based on the questions above once information is defined for the platform
* Seek pro bono support from a legal firm whose insurance will safeguard the project

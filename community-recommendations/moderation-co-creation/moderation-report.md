## **Platform - purpose**

**A, P** , g: &quot;…with this potential…really powerful source of information, we&#39;ve identified certain things we could do to optimise the use of it&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…what I feel is very important about the whole project today…is that sensory differences, even though there&#39;s research out that says its prevalent in up to 90% of people, it&#39;s still very under-addressed and un-empathised with&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…because people are able to express themselves in tons of different places, like blogs or whatever, and you&#39;ve just flagged some of the issues about people who just take stuff off social media or whatever, would it be a situation where you could put a call out and say, &#39;if you&#39;ve written about this on your blog or whatever you could just copy and paste it&#39;&quot;

R, d: &quot;…I think people would be allowed to self-plagiarise. I think people could copy and paste their own stuff onto there and that would be fine. But I think a call for specific experiences - I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve thought about that specifically. I think there&#39;s a lot of steps before we get there&quot;

R, d: &quot;I think this idea of getting people&#39;s stories as people go about their daily lives is both to give autistic people a platform on which their voices are heard, to educate non-autistic people that this [sensory processing differences] is a really thing, and really what matters is someone else&#39;s experience.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I would be concerned if people were understanding that it&#39;s all things for all people – it&#39;s for a specific purpose, and therefore you will have lines that just can&#39;t be crossed, and that&#39;s okay if you want to go and put it elsewhere, but you need to maintain an ecosystem, that&#39;s how I would approach it.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be like a Reddit thread that could run out of control. It&#39;s not a message board, it&#39;s not Twitter, it&#39;s not something that people can comment on&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot;…one of the things that&#39;s come up is, there are lots and lots of places for autistic people and parents of autistic people and autistic parents of autistic people, there&#39;s lots of places for people with complex needs to share their experiences – you can go on blogs, you can look on other social media platforms, forums and so on…some of those [platforms] are used for research, but they&#39;re not often used for research, so a lot of times the experiences that autistic people have don&#39;t actually make it into the knowledge, into the minds of people who can change things&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…unfortunately, for rightly or wrongly, blog posts don&#39;t carry as much policy making emphasis as a research paper&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot;…there&#39;s a bridging aspect of saying that there&#39;s all of this knowledge that&#39;s not getting into the minds of probably neurotypical people, who probably don&#39;t understand the diversity of experience&quot;

**A** , d &quot;…for me at the moment I feel like it is almost unclear what is the main purpose of this platform - because I&#39;ve seen the communities that are online, I don&#39;t think it would be needed to vent, and I don&#39;t really understand why people would feel the need to use a brand-new platform to do so&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;That&#39;s the issue of giving people the right brief…even just a really simple example of that, and trying to engender a sense of…what&#39;s useful for research and describing what happened, rather than why it made you feel a certain way, is maybe more useful&quot;

**A** , d **:**&quot;It has to be emphasised that that is what this is – it isn&#39;t a site to let go of your feelings, it&#39;s a site to inform us about your experiences&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;When I first looked at the stuff that was sent around briefly, my first comment was, &quot;hey, this needs to be a platform for autistic people to also become more self-aware about sensory&quot;

**P, A** , d: Autistic people offer each other, &quot;peer support type thing and mentoring…I think that has to be a real… key part of this forum, and I think that has to be really up there&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;Where we see a [in]…a lot of autistic communities money going to non-autistic organisations to support the autistic person&quot;.

**P, A** , g: &quot;What we&#39;re not seeing is the effort and resources for autistic people to support themselves, and provide peer support and mentoring, from those shared experiences&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;This would be a real missed opportunity if it&#39;s [the platform] not achieving that [creating self-awareness] as well. It&#39;s peer support, sharing strategies.

**P, A** , d: &quot;That [sharing strategies] was mentioned in the presentation, but that emphasis didn&#39;t come out in the…bits I&#39;d scanned quickly before the meeting.&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…by doing that [sharing strategies] and sharing with other people it helps autistic people, but also others who have relationships with them: so families, communities, schools…&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…because we don&#39;t have an interactive element…like on the Insight Facebook page, I would have thought that this was data collection and research first and foremost, and that ultimately when it came to a certain point, then someone might be tasked with the responsibility of extracting what was useful to – I don&#39;t know, form the basis for peer support.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &#39;I just wanted to make a general comment on…everything here – we talk about…the current thinking is autistic voice first, but welcoming all voices related to the community, but I&#39;m thinking, the autistic voice is always the minor voice in terms of number…so it may not be balanced on there.&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…obviously the emphasis, the priority has to be the people on the people on the spectrum, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt about it.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…it&#39;s not a social media platform, you&#39;re not responding to it, it&#39;s not a forum, it&#39;s not where you have conversations with people, but it is supposed to be useful in terms of seeing what other people are experiencing and maybe seeing yourself in some of those&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I&#39;ve been blogging for 9 years, and I&#39;m on multiple communities online…I won&#39;t deny when I started working with young reps and they said, &#39;yeah is that necessary, there&#39;s information sits everywhere&#39;, and now that I&#39;ve seen it I&#39;m like, &#39;oh man yes this is perfect&#39;, so it might just be that I can&#39;t visualise it yet, but it might just be the whole iPad situation where you don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary and then everyone needs one&quot;

**A,** g: &quot;It makes sense that this is an information collection site…and I think that&#39;s kind of how it has to be known almost because…there are people who want to come on for answers, and there are people who said that in the previous group as well&quot;

**A,** g: &quot;I just think there are so many other platforms where people already go for support, you know, you&#39;ve already mentioned Twitter, Instagram and Facebook…&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;It&#39;s information about sensory processes, not support&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s not a chatroom, it&#39;s not a Reddit thread&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…it seems to me that the burden is on the researchers to really set out at the beginning what this [platform] is for – and constructive contribution&#39;s helpful&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…it seems to me that that is what this kind of research is useful for – the people using it should trying to be building solutions, and it doesn&#39;t matter how upset someone&#39;s parents are, or how embarrassed they were in a society that doesn&#39;t understand or respect different people – it&#39;s immaterial. The point is you just have to…support their needs better, it doesn&#39;t matter how anyone feels about it.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I agree&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if I was a researcher and I particularly was interested in the experiences of autistic people and how it could be better for them, then I would be super interested in prioritising those [autistic] voices&quot;

## **Motivation to take part**

**A** , d: &quot;[When] I write it helps me process, and every time I write something difficult, I write it with the mindset that if one person reads it and thinks they&#39;re not alone, or that they can cope better with their issues, then I achieved something.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I never write anything just for me, and although personally I&#39;ve never reached that point where it would flag up concerns, I feel having it available. perhaps in a more secure part of the site, could be beneficial to a broad amount of people.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;[sharing own stories is] why I felt more connected to the community, because I was reading blogs of non-speaking autistics, and how I became aware was not necessarily having an interaction with anyone, but reading what they had written.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think it&#39;s just a different way [sharing experiences in writing], I suppose…it might be appealing to more people, more autistic people, because they have no expectation to talk or interact.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;Perhaps we&#39;d better put a description…where people would tick the box and maybe share it with the researchers and not share it with anyone else, or, you know, they might not, they might have done that based on poor experience of people sharing if they&#39;ve put it before, so maybe there should be a description of the benefits for people, what can we gain from it, so if they read that, they&#39;ll go, &quot;oh right, so instead of being nervous about sharing it with other people I&#39;ll just tick this box&quot;.

**P, A** , d: &quot;I talk about this [platform] being a kind of mentoring as well for autistic people to autistic people, because I didn&#39;t even have a clue I had sensory issues, and it&#39;s not until recently that I started to think, well, &#39;Why do I feel dizzy?&#39;, &#39;Why do I feel staggered?&#39;, &#39;Why am I feeling like this?&#39;. I&#39;m already 13 years past diagnosis, and it&#39;s only now that I&#39;m realising, which I do, – &#39;ooh, it&#39;s a sensory thing&#39;, I&#39;m sort of feeling sick now or light-headed or staggering or not well, you know, but I didn&#39;t even know that before.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s a lot of probably educating people on this platform as well about sensory issues&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;…my son hasn&#39;t put anything in it yet [the project], although he knows that I have, and he goes &#39;what&#39;s the point of it?&#39;, &#39;what will they do with it&#39;?, and I think that somehow or other the endgame will qualify how some people will stay with the process and even report on behalf of somebody else: What&#39;s the game? What&#39;s the thing that will happen?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think just people sharing their own story is very powerful&quot;

**A, P,** g: &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want this platform to oversimplify what sensory issues are for autistic people…It&#39;s not a matter of &#39;it&#39;s light or sound&#39;…therefore we can put our glasses on, or put earphones on, and then &quot;whoopdie-doo&quot;, all solved&quot;

## **Diagnosis or original awareness of autism**

**A** , d: &quot;I&#39;ve only been recently diagnosed in the last couple of years…back when I got to the age of about 40…so I&#39;ve been going up a learning curve pretty quickly,

**A** , d: &quot;I got diagnosed at 32, so it was a mystery for most of my life why I was so different and why I was so strange to other people&quot;

**A** , **P,** g: &quot;…just having a diagnosis doesn&#39;t help you immediately be more self-aware about who you are, your needs, or strategies to help yourself&quot;

**A** , **P** d: &quot;I wasn&#39;t diagnosed until 62&quot;

**A** , **P,** d &quot;It&#39;s an aspect of dyspraxia, I&#39;m still waiting to be assessed, but there&#39;s people who have actually had their co-occurring and co-conditions already assessed&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…we knew about [autistic daughter&#39;s epilepsy] much earlier, we actually didn&#39;t know she had autism…until she was doing her GCSEs&quot;

**P** , i: Daughter&#39;s diagnosis was 9 years ago [when she was 16], and she is 25 now

**P** , i: &quot;…my son was diagnosed when he was 4, so really early, actually. The school noticed when he was young, when he was only in reception class.&quot;

**P** , i: &#39;he [autistic son] was diagnosed a week before his 5th birthday.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;I&#39;ve been 12 years diagnosed now, and it&#39;s only been from reading the work of other autistic people having to do with sensory issues, I had no clue before.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…I found out about sensory difficulties within a year of my diagnosis, and it&#39;s only in the past – nine years on – that I&#39;ve begun to discover how I can work with them&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I didn&#39;t get diagnosed until I was 40 and I held down a decent job and nobody knew, me included.&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;It&#39;s more often than not that people just don&#39;t quite have the right kind of guidance [when they first learn about autism]&quot;

**A,** i: &quot;…they [my parents] found out the hard way&quot;

## **How should we think and talk about autistic people and autism?**

**A,** d: &quot;I think also emphasising that there are 2 phenotypes would be useful – because that&#39;s why I use that term [&#39;ASC&#39;], because my official diagnosis is &#39;Asperger&#39;s syndrome&#39;, but as soon as I say it, it comes with connotations I don&#39;t meet, because I&#39;m female…so I&#39;ve never felt that is my diagnosis, so I would rather say straight out I have &#39;high-functioning&#39; autism. or I&#39;m on the autistic spectrum, than tell them I have Asperger&#39;s and have them immediately think that I&#39;m Sheldon Cooper.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think that you&#39;ve raised a really good point [about the importance of terminology].&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…what is considered to be offensive to others… is a matter of terminology as well&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…obviously all of these conditions come with lots of different terminology.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I personally refer to myself as having ASD, but I know we&#39;re no longer using that term in education anymore, as my teacher once told me.&quot;

**A,** d: I know that there&#39;s a lot of terminology…and I&#39;ve met people who don&#39;t like certain terms.

**A,** d: &quot;[I&#39;ve met people] who don&#39;t like the &quot;D&quot; (&quot;disorder) … of the &#39;ASD&#39;.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;Yeah, because it&#39;s not a disorder, it&#39;s a condition. I think they call it &#39;ASC&#39;…&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think for me, speaking personally, I don&#39;t really mind [about terminology].&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I find it more distracting getting caught upon what some people think is less important, you know, the technical definition. I get distracted from the point I was actually trying to make.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I use that term [&#39;ASD&#39;] about myself, so I&#39;m not being disrespectful.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;[In co-production group]…we always invite comments, and…when I do my representation for building design, I do such a broad stroke, I do every single neurodiversity plus other people.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I think…we need to go that route [broad neurodiversity] more&quot;

**P, A,** g: &quot;I don&#39;t like the way that [R] was positioning it, that people have different experiences of their autism… people&#39;s autism is very different for them, when actually they&#39;re autistic people with different experiences&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;…the other point we had was about autism: does your autism give you more trouble in this area or not, or people have different experiences about their autism, and I think that really puts people&#39;s autism as a discreet part of them, whereas really it&#39;s experiences of autistic people.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;That may be with co-occurring conditions, it may be with sensory issues or anything like that, so it&#39;s important to get that right, and it may be with the literature…I think it&#39;s not &#39;experiences people have of their autism&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;experiences autistic people have.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;Or &#39;experiences people with autism have&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I sort of think if myself as coming in thirds…&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s difficult to say this, but you can&#39;t actually force change on society around you, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been forced to learn over the years growing up&quot;

## **Experiences of sensory processing differences**

**A, P** , g: &quot;In my co-production [group] we have people who just say &#39;sensory triggers&#39;, because we&#39;ve got a whole lot of people who don&#39;t want to go for any form of diagnosis, but they recognise that [in] certain environments there&#39;s always auditory triggering, there&#39;s visual triggering, etc.

**P, A,** d &quot;…I shouldn&#39;t even be on the planet, I have no spatial knowledge other than crossing the main road. Every other road that exists – it&#39;s there in periphery vision…I&#39;m still in my head, I could have been knocked over umpteen times passing side roads with zero awareness of where I am… I&#39;m just moving… along this road with no sense of when there&#39;s danger, it&#39;s just – you&#39;re there but you&#39;re not there. So then if you complicate that by not being able to express it, then, I mean how are we ever going to improve environments and make it safer for people to move around?&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I&#39;ve absorbed information before my diagnosis by a mixture of visuals and responding to things that other people have created&quot;

**P, A,** d &quot;I find my ears sometimes are listening down across the side round and my eyes are absorbing information around here, and I&#39;ll stop and realise I didn&#39;t even look around.&quot;

**P, A,** d &quot;Yes, yes, precisely!&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…but you can&#39;t always stay indoors, you need to go outdoors, whether assisted or not, and to go to different places, and do different things, so I don&#39;t know because we&#39;re doing it sort of forward-looking in one direction only, and I don&#39;t know how else to describe it.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I wasn&#39;t even aware of sensory issues and what that meant, so I think there&#39;s this huge piece of education, and so it would be to share that aspect [knowledge about sensory differences]&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;[I would want to share] so people don&#39;t think, &#39;oh I just need to know if they have sensory issues to light or to sound&#39;. It&#39;s not quite like that, there&#39;s a whole other aspect&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…we have a consultant doing work with people on this estate, and they&#39;ve done a wallpaper presentation of stick people that look frantic, when they put the other information across this wallpaper, I&#39;m screaming, &#39;please can you take out some of the wallpaper or reduce the stick figures or something&#39;, it&#39;s too busy for me to understand the text.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I know, or they have this image and then these words and then you spend your time going, &#39;how is that supposed to relate to this picture, and is there some other information I should be accessing?&#39;&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;[wearing headphones is the] kind of a habit really she&#39;s [autistic daughter] just got herself into. I think she likes to take out extraneous noise.&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;It&#39;s these sensory things [sensitivity to extraneous noise] that neurotypicals don&#39;t get - well, some do on some occasions but it&#39;s very hard to grasp&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;…the floor being slightly unbalanced, like the floor in my supermarket…I&#39;m known to stagger, as if I&#39;m slightly drunk, or if the floor&#39;s a little bit uneven, because I have vestibular issues.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…in hindsight I understand that that [sensory processing] was pretty much the cause of every issue that we had as a family, and I now understand that there are ways that I can deal with that in the future&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…getting a free pair of beats headphones with my laptop has totally changed my life.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;My problem is – well I&#39;ve got many, but is that I can be hugely variable from one day to the next&quot;

**A,** d, i: &quot;when I was growing up…I&#39;d have meltdowns in public areas…and my parents often wouldn&#39;t know what to do as well.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I worked in an office where there was a prayer room, and I kept having panic attacks a lot, and someone said to me … &#39;oh you can go to the prayer room&#39;, and it was a bit awkward because obviously it was mostly for people who need to go and pray 5 times a day, but it was useful to know that if I just thought… I feel that I&#39;m getting het up to the extent that I&#39;m going to do something or say something that I don&#39;t want to at work, I can just go to this place&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…if every train station had a…a quiet room: not where someone can go and have a business conversation on their phone, but…an actual quiet room where you can appreciate if you&#39;re in it that some people might be trying to quieten down, rather than you have to be quiet like in a library, it&#39;s just a quiet space where people understand that the world can be a difficult place and we have a space, so that you&#39;re not on a platform or a concourse&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I did have lots of noise sensitivities, not just in social situations, but I didn&#39;t like the fireworks going off around me, I used to really, really, really dread bonfire&#39;s night as well as new year&#39;s eve coming around every single year, because I knew that I would not only have to put fingers in my ears, but also even put some red headphones around me just to block out the noise – and some of the ways my parents would bear the brunt of it, I honestly thought like, &#39;oh, this bad thing&#39;, and the fear would also then catch up with me emotionally in order for me to have my train of thought of, you know, how to get over that particular fear. The way they would deal with it would be they would also write to the local MSP, member of the Scottish national parliament, to basically say, &#39;you know we need to ban these fireworks&#39;, just to deal with the sensitivity that I had. And then growing up I had, at the age of 13, when I was taken to my first fireworks display, I began to understand why people chose to celebrate with those items every year, if I can so loosely refer to it, and it&#39;s only because they have a particular reason to do so – and you validify what it really is. And I went to a particular fireworks display and when I could hear it going off, sure enough, my fear started to dramatically go away, albeit it just went away slightly.&quot;

## **Non-autistic responses to autistic people and autism**

**A** , d: &quot;…since I&#39;m &#39;high-functioning&#39; myself, my parents do tell me their stories about how they had to deal with me growing up, because I had lots of hearing sensitivities and I had lots of social problems.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…just for context, I was ridiculed from the moment I first set foot in school because I behaved in a &#39;not normal&#39; way, and I was dubbed bad, and none of it was ever in my control. But I wasn&#39;t diagnosed with autism until I left school.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think that growing up thinking that I was constantly naughty meant that I was depressed by the age of 7&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I feel like I minutely interrogate everything I think and feel, because I&#39;ve been made to feel strange for my whole life&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…lots of neurotypical people…if someone was being terrible in an office, and maybe it really upset me, and I would go and speak to someone and they&#39;d be like, &#39;oh, they&#39;ve just been dumped by their girlfriend&#39;, it blew my mind – just sort of like, &#39;how could they let that affect how they interact with me as if I&#39;ve done something terrible?&#39;&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I&#39;m a human library book and when I&#39;m being read as an autistic person, [people] say, &#39;Are you here to talk about autism?&#39;. I say, &#39;no, I&#39;m talking about me as an autistic person, and my experience of the world&#39;, and so they have to correct how they introduce me.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;Neurotypical people often make me think, &#39;well how on earth am I supposed to follow that.&#39;&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;My wife always suspected [autistic daughter] had a bit [of autism]: she had a bit of experience I never had.&quot;

**P** , g: &#39;like most people I…knew nothing about it [autism]&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;he [autistic son] is 19 now, so it&#39;s been most of his life…it&#39;s been around all the time for us.&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;[Autism was] certainly not something I knew about, not something anybody knew anything about&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s been a total learning curve. I&#39;ve been learning everything, finding out everything, finding every stage -&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…when you&#39;re ignorant, you&#39;re ignorant… we&#39;re not malignantly ignorant, unfortunately we just are…&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…she&#39;ll [autistic daughter] tell you about a lot of what she experienced at school…out and out prejudice really&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…we do have these [strains to do with normativity] quite a lot…particularly when there&#39;s been a meltdown that one could predict…then you get a row afterwards&quot;

**P** , i: [About an autistic woman] &quot;…she&#39;s gone off to uni – she didn&#39;t last long in uni because other issues cropped up, like everything that&#39;s happened this year, combined with her ASD that messed it up for her.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…I&#39;m the parent of somebody&#39;s who&#39;s high-functioning, so that comes with its own pros and con&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot; …this is quite a common dynamic whether someone&#39;s autistic or not, right, so there&#39;s a kind of a natural period of rebellion maybe…&quot;

R, _T_, d :&#39; my attitude to my parent&#39;s view of me has changed over time a lot, like my assessment of whether they do actually know what&#39;s best for me, and I think that&#39;s a kind of journey that many people are on&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;I think autism complicates it [the dynamic with parents] because I think it&#39;s been so misunderstood by society, and science before&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;it&#39;s been constant battles we never wanted to fight and never thought we would, but we&#39;ve had to.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;Without going into the battles I&#39;m glad you said that&quot;

**P** , i &quot;If you&#39;ve got ASD you&#39;re a target for being bullied, I think we all know that, but one of my other daughters who was at the same school, she was being bullied on behalf of her sister who was being bullied.&quot;

**P** , i &quot;…we sent them to different schools just for that reason [because of bullying], because we have a different second name as well, so it&#39;s not even like &quot;Smith&quot; where you could be like, well he&#39;s not – people know straight away. But we chose different schools so he could be [name] and not just [A]&#39;s brother. So that he could be an individual and start without the teachers knowing about him being [A]&#39;s brother, and he could start with individuality, so yeah, it&#39;s a challenge&quot;.

**P,** g: &quot;I know people have been learning a lot about these non-aggressive or passive response methods… but it requires a very conscious effort for somebody to acquire those skills, because the whole thing is counterintuitive.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…stop telling me to get out of bed and ask me, &#39;would you like to get out of bed?&quot;
**P,** i: &quot;…whether that&#39;s [not wanting to get out of bed] an ASD thing or not I don&#39;t know&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing better than my daughter to live for, so it&#39;s just as well I love all of her…I understand that autism, and all her co-occurring conditions, are an intrinsic part of who she is&quot;.

**A** , d: &quot;…the issue I&#39;ve always had is that because of my conditions that they weren&#39;t fully understood, I was ridiculed when I entered school as a &#39;bad child&#39;…my entire life the only people who haven&#39;t seen me as bad are my parents&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…we&#39;ve got hundreds and hundreds of letters hidden around the house of me apologising every time I got in trouble, because I was so ashamed that I was being bad&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I also talked in our group…about the effects on siblings as well…and it does go everywhere…and it doesn&#39;t just affect the person…it affects everybody around them, especially if something&#39;s not going in the way that society would want.&quot;

**P,** i: [Autistic daughter] frequently will say to us in a moment of frustration, &quot;as parents you say you love me, but you don&#39;t love that [autistic] part of me,&quot; and my response is usually something like, &quot;it&#39;s hard to do that in the moment&quot;, and this kind of thing, that autism is a building block within a person who has a condition and that it is invariably felt by people in a family as a negative thing, I mean it is not nice for a person with ASD to experience that.&quot;

**P** , g/i: &quot;people don&#39;t want meltdowns, but they happen, and unfortunately a neurotypical way of dealing with it is – well, you could say it is negative, but it is a gut reaction, and even with all of the awareness and training that I&#39;ve collected over the years…it&#39;s very difficult.&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;…my parents ended up having to learn it [guidance on dealing with meltdowns] from the units I attended…particularly in primary school, that look this is the ways that you&#39;ve got to [speak] to your child&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;you [parents] have got to say to…your [autistic] son or daughter, &#39;right, this is what we&#39;ve got to do today&#39;, and it&#39;s got some example, like, &quot;a moment from now – we&#39;re gonna do this this or that, and it&#39;s gonna be the next thing.&quot;

**A,** i: &quot;…I think a lot of the things that non-autistic people think autistic people do is rude, is because they&#39;re [non-autistic people] trained not to…say the truth.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…at the same time we need to try and say about society, if they want to learn about disability rights and the way we need to cope with things in society, we need to reach out to society in a way that says, &#39;we need you to understand our trains of thought&#39;, without then imposing any strains of political correctness on them at the same time.&quot;

**A,** g: &quot;…there&#39;s been a trend going around, and I see it especially in places like England, whereby if anyone were to be told, &#39;okay you&#39;re going to learn about disability rights today&#39;, or even with the same issue like minority rights or environment issues, the standard response would be, &#39;oh gosh, we&#39;re gonna get talked to, we&#39;re gonna have our hearts and our minds changed all the time&#39;, and I think it&#39;s really important that we cannot go into that particular realm of suspicion, because I&#39;ve been through the main teachings of how we get people to understand our concerns&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I once had a problem that if someone at work wrote me an email that I thought was rude or whatever, I&#39;d just respond like whatever, and then it would be a problem, because I&#39;d said what I really thought – and what I learned was that you&#39;re not supposed to do that, you have to train yourself to be different.&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;maybe they [parents] had to let off some steam about it because, well who knows what could happen if the parent was told, &quot;well you&#39;re not allowed to say it&quot;…they&#39;ve [parents] therefore got to keep it within themselves&quot;…if they [parents] keep having to hold it back and hold it back and hold it back…the main problem that might develop from it is that this builds up and builds up like a bubble until something really triggers them to go over the edge and they implode one day, and they may end up really going over the edge and doing something really bad even to other people around them, or to their child itself – so that&#39;s the main point I ended up wanting to raise about it.&quot;

## **Code of Conduct**

**A, P** , d **:**&quot;…this is where laws are very important because there&#39;s nothing that can help the world go around more than to have a clear set of rules to say, &quot;actually, what you did was in breach of this&quot;…and then to be collaborators with people who are trying to contribute to the site, instead of being gatekeepers.

**A** , d: &quot;What…people tend to find in good taste and what they find in bad taste in general tends to be quite subjective&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I … agree with all of the points that have been made around the subjective nature of a lot of these sorts of issues.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…there are certain things that will be obvious in terms of their intention and in terms of their harm, that can be easily dealt with, but a lot of this is very subjective.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I mean, honestly that&#39;s particularly an issue with autistic people, I&#39;ve got to say that&#39;s me in many situations, you know – we think our views are facts, and it&#39;s hard to take in other&#39;s opinions – I&#39;m not generalising though&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of things that we&#39;re being told nowadays that we can and cannot say, and of course the latter keeps expanding and expanding and expanding, which includes even the most harmless and pettiest of examples.:&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;How can we be sure that the things we do contribute to these sorts of platform…can actually be balanced enough to…say, &#39;we have enough to express ourselves?&#39;&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if somebody was to say something that you or I wouldn&#39;t like, then it&#39;s best to deal with it in a public debate, in an open space, rather than just trying to censor that particular thing – so there needs to be a clear balance struck out.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;That makes me feel…super uncomfortable.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…in terms of the language people use and knowing whether things might be offensive to people…my job is a journalist, and I&#39;m an editor, and I&#39;ve edited a lot of people&#39;s opinion articles, and one of the things that I&#39;ve found most useful, especially when I&#39;m dealing with people who aren&#39;t writers but are writing about their experience, is to try and make sure people remember to write from their perspective, and that they&#39;re saying what happened to them and what they think, and I&#39;m trying not to make generalisations about people or groups of people, and that often helps people to say, &#39;this thing happened to me&#39;, and, &#39;here&#39;s how it was and here&#39;s how I felt&#39;, rather than, &#39;this group of people does this type of thing to people like me&#39;, which is…automatically much more confrontational even if it is essentially trying to tell the same story.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…have a way to really emphasise to people not to make generalisations, and that they&#39;re…completely allowed to say what happened to them and what they think about something but making sure that they take ownership of the pieces that they&#39;re using, not kind of broad-brushing over whole groups of people, which is when you tend to get issues where it&#39;s sort of offensive.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;a code of conduct almost feels like a political or an academic kind of thing&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;One thing I question is, is code of conduct actually the right word or phrase to use… we&#39;ve got this whole thing about high functioning, low functioning autism, or whatever, and some people are gonna get it, and some people won&#39;t, so obviously a lot of things like that need to be looked at.

R, _T_, d: &quot;…having clear rules [is] the best way I can think of to resolve some of that ambiguity which results from different subjective views&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;Certainly, I&#39;m finding it quite complex…all the different balancing acts with all the different points of view.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…my feeling is, having to actually concretely design this in some way…probably there&#39;s no prefect solution for everyone, but... a reasonable balance.&quot;

**P** , g: [Emphasis on treating everyone as an individual] &quot;…everybody who&#39;s involved with people on the spectrum – we all know that the answer is to learn, and it&#39;s not easy, it&#39;s to learn how to treat each person as an individual, that&#39;s all we really need to do as human beings, and that would sort out all the problems in the world, wouldn&#39;t it? But we&#39;re talking about something much smaller…I&#39;m just wondering if that could maybe come in as a sort of, as an umbrella thought for this thing?&quot;

R, _T_, d &quot;I think that&#39;s a really great suggestion&quot;

R, _T_, d &quot;I think the AutAngels one [code of conduct] that I was using as a basis really emphasises that everyone is different, and that&#39;s a positive thing about this community&quot;

R, _T_, d &quot;…if you can take time to appreciate different people, and the different ways of being in the world and ways they like to express themselves, then that&#39;s useful.&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;It&#39;s easy to say this, isn&#39;t it&quot;

R, _T_, d &quot;Yeah, and hard to do – &quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…everyone has to deal with Donald Trump for 4 years, and…he&#39;s started this thing…He&#39;ll say to journalists, &quot;I don&#39;t like you and I don&#39;t believe a word you say&quot;, and obviously that has coloured a lot of opinions in many different areas – but…that&#39;s hopefully on the way out now…

R, _T_, d &quot;Yeah, I think it does take a lot more attention and effort than maybe it seems at first to carve out a space where that doesn&#39;t happen&quot;

**A,** g: &quot;you&#39;re never going to find the perfect middle ground, but you have to get as close as you possibly can and then try to review that as time goes on.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I think it&#39;s important about the advisory thing, about how to go about putting in posts, so for instance if the bit about reporting on behalf of other people was done by one or two of the moderators and co-produced or something, that might be better than it being written by the researcher describing, &#39;well that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got to do&#39;, so you know it&#39;s somebody autistic, or you know has a knowledge of how easy it is to just vent…and then they say, &#39;try not to&#39;, it would…carry more weight.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I think is really interesting, if we&#39;re writing a code of conduct, how do we make sure that it&#39;s not – basically just discriminating against autistic people by being a kind of non-autistic view of what&#39;s appropriate?&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Good question&quot;

R, _T,_ i: &quot;…a lot of people in previous discussion brought up that their sense of what was rude was different to what non-autistic people might judge as being rude&quot;

R, _T,_ i: &quot;…they were constantly thinking, &#39;I have to change my behaviour to make someone who&#39;s not autistic feel comfortable, and they&#39;re never changing their behaviour to make me feel comfortable&#39;

**A,** d: &quot;[if] somebody says something that you disagree with you can disagree with them in a civil way.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;a code of conduct almost feels like a political or an academic kind of thing&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think that some of the values are really clear at the outset, that it isn&#39;t a place to vent…it is supposed to be truthful, but you should be thinking about what you&#39;re saying before you say it.&quot;

R, _T,_ i: &quot;…having autistic people write it was what I thought would be the most helpful thing.&quot;

## Feedback on existing code of conduct

**A** , d: &quot;…because I have epilepsy, I&#39;m a strong advocate for co-morbidity and I think it is brilliant that you are mentioning it straight out, because I find that on the other side neurology doesn&#39;t necessarily consider autism as much&quot;

**A, d** : &quot;I&#39;m not sure if autism is considered to be a neurological condition, but it is often tied to neurological conditions&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…I think we just said with the behaviours part that you have to put &#39;placeism&#39;.&quot;

**A, d** : &quot;I mentioned to you briefly about the word &#39;neurology&#39;, and I was just wondering if you or any other...moderators on here would be able to clarify specifically what they meant by that?&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think just working out specifically what is meant by that term [&#39;neurology&#39;] and working out a more direct way of explaining that [would help].

**A** , d: &quot;…my first question as someone with a co-morbid neurological condition is that, in the list of self-identifying factors, what is specifically meant by neurology?&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I really do love that neurological differences is emphasised as from the other side of it, autism is often totally ignored in the neurology world, so yeah, to me that was interesting, but unspecific.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…when I read that paragraph with the four social rules, I found it really, I think, condescending in a way – &quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t like those [the four social rules] at all&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…I saw &#39;no feigning surprise&#39;, and I thought, &quot;Huh! I&#39;m an autistic person, I have to act all the time about being surprised, or being happy.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;[It] does feel a bit, I don&#39;t know, condescending to have this, &#39;no feigning surprise&#39; when actually autistic people have to mask in order to fit in&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;It [the &#39;no feigning surprise rule] wasn&#39;t mentioned that way, and it was about being condescending to others.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I&#39;m not an alien in all my social conversations, so I don&#39;t automatically go through all these variations, so to see it written out like that, I thought, &#39;why do we have to do that&#39;, and I just found that personally confusing…the idea that there&#39;s social principles&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I struggle with the fact that…autism is a social communication disorder, so…using words like &#39;social principles&#39; makes me feel like you have to pass through…some kind of judgement barrier in order to do stuff.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;Yeah, I think that, because I think especially when you go into the four social rules there&#39;s a whole block of writing about, it&#39;s almost like, &#39;Oh, because you&#39;ve got social communication difficulties, we&#39;re going to tell you how to be polite, and I think that could be worded in a more constructive-criticism way.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;These [the four social rules] are like good illustrations, asking autistic people for things.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;[It&#39;s] just the tone – I mean, I&#39;m quite aware I need a nudge now and then…it&#39;s always helpful to remind me now and then not to speak over people too much. But I think there&#39;s a less condescending way of doing that&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I&#39;m not sure [about] the 5th bullet of expected behaviour… this [platform] isn&#39;t just for non-autistic people, this is for everyone…it just seems weird the way it&#39;s drafted it&#39;s just a bit limited. I think it needs to be broader in scope.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;Yeah, so I guess the way I took that [the 5th bullet of expected behaviour] is kind of, when you&#39;re talking about your experiences, don&#39;t be like, &#39;this autistic person in the cinema kept talking and rocking, and it was really distracting&#39;.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…if this [code of conduct] is focussed foremost on autistic people sharing their experiences, then this [the 5th bullet point] is a bit of a funny bullet.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think we …need to…word it [the 5th bullet point] differently&quot;

**P, A** , d: [Reword the 5th bullet point], &quot;to be more inclusive&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…the first bullet in 2.2… has got that language, &#39;if they don&#39;t feel positive about their autism&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…the language being used, so wondering if you actually discussed that in your groups?&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…in our breakout room we raised points on the language generally as well, things like, it&#39;s all well and good people on the autistic spectrum having social difficulties, but it did feel quite condescending when you went and launched into, &quot;don&#39;t feign surprise&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I didn&#39;t even know what feigned means, for one&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;…before I went into what you [researchers] were trying to say, and the thought behind it, I thought, &quot;well, you spend your life putting on an act that&#39;s socially appropriate, and now you&#39;re trying to tell us not to feign being surprised: but maybe we&#39;re actually supposed to be surprised and then we have to go and do it&quot;, so I&#39;ve fed that back, and some of the language I thought was a little bit condescending in my view.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…there&#39;s quite a lot of things that are quite easy fixes
 R, _T,_ d: &quot;we can fix… the phrasing of the guidelines for the platform&quot;
 R, _T,_ d: &quot;…we can use a standard sort of voice&quot;
 R, _T,_ d: &quot;…I hadn&#39;t read that blog post about the social norms in a long time…I haven&#39;t read it in probably two years, and now that you say, it&#39;s absolutely full of idioms…and that is unnecessarily complicated for the points that we want to make, so…that&#39;s the key thing.&quot;

## Tone

**A** , d: &quot;I&#39;ve had this issue with my editorial board at [organisation], because we&#39;re trying to make a blog site that is fully accessible to everybody, in aged 16-25, that doesn&#39;t sound patronising, and it is going to be very difficult to find that middle ground&quot;
**A** , d: &quot;…a tone of voice, as well as a code of conduct, is essential for any of these kind of platforms&quot;
 R, _T,_ d: &quot;I just wanted to circle back to: [A], you made a point about a tone of voice – so there&#39;s a code of conduct and then there&#39;s a tone of voice for the platform – and I&#39;m curious to have us sort of dig into that a little bit more, because I think I don&#39;t totally understand what you mean by tone of voice for the platform.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;I mean, this is not a platform that you&#39;re going to be posting on, it&#39;s different when it&#39;s a platform that the organisation is posting on.&quot;
**A** , d: &quot;…coming up with a set of rules for yourself, I mean a set of rules how it would be worded on the site, and a set off rules if somebody would get a response from a moderator, to say this is inappropriate, just making sure there is a continual, there is a consistency across all the language that is used on the platform itself, and making sure that that is the right way of saying things&quot;
**A** : &quot;so it&#39;s not too strict but it&#39;s not too simple; it&#39;s not too complicated to understand but it&#39;s not too patronising…finding that middle ground and making sure everything written on the site follows that same pattern, essentially&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…it does make sense, yeah, I mean all these things are true so to speak&quot;

## Metaphorical/non-literal language

**A, P** , d: &quot;…to me there was some language in there [about the four social rules] that wasn&#39;t necessarily understandable to a lot of autistic people, including a lot of idioms, indeed there were two in one explanation. The section is literally called &quot;back street driving&quot;, and then the second section uses the phrase &quot;too many cooks&quot;, and…if you&#39;re using that kind of language to explain something to autistic people it&#39;s probably it&#39;s not going to work so well.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I think most people know: do most people not know about that [the use of idioms]? It&#39;s just like learning another piece of a language, that we&#39;ve done in our lifetimes?&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I know friends of mine only take everything literally. There are certain idioms that, although I knew what they meant, I found them bizarre growing up; like the idea of flying colours - colours don&#39;t fly&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…fair point, we should demonstrate that we are autistic-aware by not throwing in those things [idioms].&#39;

###

## Negative language

**A,** g: &quot;…it literally could just be that the person does not know how to articulate what they were going to say, and it ends up inappropriate, and that just would be discriminatory to remove that post just because they&#39;re struggling&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;using…swearwords, however petty, like &#39;bloody meltdown&#39; or whatever, it&#39;s not helpful to the research&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I&#39;ll admit I probably swear more, I do swear more, than I…sometimes I don&#39;t even know that I&#39;m doing it, so I can accidentally say a word and not know&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;…in society there is not such a massive understanding of why someone – a child or an adult - would have a meltdown – and using language that makes it seem like an unreasonable and bad thing that they&#39;ve done is really unhelpful, when actually we know that the world has not been designed for autistic people&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think that you can say that non-autistic people must try not to complain or criticise autistic people&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;We&#39;re going to keep facilitating stigma if that&#39;s the way we&#39;re going to treat [autism]: &#39;this autism, this bit of my autism means this for me&#39;, no, &#39;this is who I am&#39;, so I think we need to have (R) fostering the right language as well…it&#39;s autistic people&#39;s experiences, not people&#39;s experiences of their autism.&quot;

**A,** R, _A,_ i: &quot;I imagine with (R) it was probably just a bad phrasing, she&#39;s normally very sensitive to that…&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…one way to do that [deal with swearwords in posts] would be to have very explicitly somewhere in the code of conduct: &quot;you can express yourself with swearwords in a frustrated way, in an angry way, if that is your experience&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I use that word, that mild swearing deliberately because I think it does emphasise a point, and we don&#39;t want to censor, and we don&#39;t want to frustrate people who think this could be a much-needed opening&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I&#39;m wondering if this could be an age thing, this thing about using passionate language&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;Young people [use language differently] with even the abbreviations they&#39;re using texting or WhatsApping all the time, like the initials WTF, for example&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…when I first got an email from somebody with &quot;WTF…I messaged back and said, this is a business thing…this is not appropriate&quot;, but then that&#39;s because I&#39;m…a 60-year-old person, this would have been somebody a lot younger.

**P** , g: &quot;…whether or not you have ASD, there are some people who will be offended for one reason or another, and others wouldn&#39;t be&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…when someone ended up using that term [bloody], when we saw the comments there, I controversially did not think it was therefore exclusive of autistic people as an entire collective, but really it was an opinion-share from them, as individuals, in…the individual case of dealing with their child&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;...the main issue was we were talking about what language they can and can&#39;t use in these sorts of forums.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…it was brought up earlier in the conversation that the word, &#39;bloody&#39;, was used by one of the parents, and they say – &#39;oh it&#39;s ruined my day.&#39;…in a way it does help to understand their view of the situation.&quot;

**A,** i: &quot;…maybe if people feel they can&#39;t express themselves because they can&#39;t use that kind of word, for example, then that might mean that we might just lose a whole chunk of people, and they might be the people who don&#39;t have the opportunities for education – I don&#39;t know, I might be making totally massive assumptions.&quot;

## Emotions

**A** , d: &quot;It [the code of conduct] does say that we have the right to express our anger and frustration about things, but I feel that there are probably things that would come up, that we would try to express our anger and frustrations about that would probably personally be no doubt flagged up, and therefore probably removed in the process. So how can we be sure of that?&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;if you&#39;re saying, &#39;Oh I&#39;m the non-autistic person who&#39;s meant to be able to regulate my emotions&#39;, …you can regulate not using swearwords to describe in public your experiences of your child.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I imagine it would be helpful for the researchers, the scientists, to see the emotion&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…people have just no idea how rude they are by their emotions, they don&#39;t interrogate what they think and do, and that&#39;s a real problem with something like this, is people think their subjective view is objective fact.&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;…now the way I see it is…a lot of people, especially neurotypical people, are so emotional all the time and have no comprehension that their emotions are driving them&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;… in a practical sense it&#39;s going to be quite difficult to police that: loads of people are accidentally going to let loads of their emotions about something go in [to their story]&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;You can actually post and be fairly neutral&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…it&#39;s not about how we would be able to report it and reuse it [an experience of a parent&#39;s emotion], and the advice wouldn&#39;t be able to be used without the advice of the parent, which wouldn&#39;t help the forum or the feedback, so that might be a way to post without the emotion and the emotive side of it.&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot;…the guidance to go in the code of conduct would be, &#39;don&#39;t add your own emotion to this platform?&#39;&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…I think they [parents of autistic people] can say,&#39; this is how this person was in this environment&#39;, but not how it made me [the parent] feel when they [the autistic person] reacted like that.&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;I think that&#39;s something that has to be the facts [about the experience being shared by a non-autistic person], instead of emotion in it…when it&#39;s somebody else [other than the autistic person] who&#39;s writing it.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s also going to be positioned as a means to share statement of facts: &#39;this happened to me, and I don&#39;t understand why&#39;, or a carer or parent saying, &#39;this was a situation that happened to a person I was caring for, and I don&#39;t understand why&#39;.

**A,** d: &quot;…I&#39;m a journalist, I work with words every day, and I think there is such a difference between someone who&#39;s twisted themselves into a knot of fury about what&#39;s going on, and is just generalising and lashing out and all of this, and someone who&#39;s just used what they think is an obvious, truthful description of something but they didn&#39;t have vitriol behind it.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I appreciate this is a very tricky thing, but like I&#39;ve edited a lot of people&#39;s first-person opinion pieces, and what I always try to edit out is those words where you might be like, fuming and sticky sweaty hands because you so want to violently tell everyone what you think, and the people who are just trying to describe it and have accidentally slipped in to a thing where it&#39;s like, &#39;that isn&#39;t how we refer to those people by the way&#39;.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…what someone said to me is, &#39;if it feels really good in a mean way to write, you probably shouldn&#39;t include it&#39;, and I think that&#39;s a really good test case here, like if you went to read it out in front of people who want to give you a job, would you say it?&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…autistic people might say things that other people might think are rude, but I think it&#39;s not a different world – whereas this thing where you&#39;re trying to inflict harm with your words compared to when you&#39;re just trying to express yourself, I think that&#39;s different.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I wonder if it would be good to maybe be really obvious…maybe if you&#39;re really angry about something, offer us a solution, like &#39;what would have made it better?&#39;&quot;

**P,** g: &quot;…what we discussed was how to report without the emotion in it – so you&#39;re actually reporting about something&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I think the emotion would be really the problem for me, because I think situations can be emotive, but I think that&#39;s outside of the how that thing happened and how that made you feel has no effect on what it was that happened and the sensory issues at the time, that was your emotion about the situation, so for research purposes, I think that needs to be stipulated from the start, that that shouldn&#39;t be in it – how it made the parent or the person reporting it feel.&quot;

**A,** d, g: &quot;…at one point when I was younger, I used to think, &#39;yes, getting people to be borderline forced into it would be one way&#39;, but I learned at the same time, you can&#39;t police people&#39;s emotions and thereby how they react to things.&quot;

## **Speaking on behalf of others/supporting others to speak**

**A, P** , d: &quot;[on] that point about speaking for others, and when parents or carers do that…I think it needs to be very clear, that&#39;s your experience of a person who had potentially a sensory thing going on, and not to put any assumptions onto that person&quot;
**A, P** , d: &quot;…the example you gave in one of your quotes, if an autistic person said their parents may have said they had a meltdown and the autistic person goes, &#39;they may have had an issue with the flickering lights&quot;, go to the autistic person and go, &quot;how do you know it was the flickering lights?&quot;: it could be build up from the last three days, that the last final straw was a vestibular issue dealing with a wonky floor, not the visual image of the light&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…to change it back to this separation, when I was thinking about…conflicts…between parents using the site, and…actual autistic people, I was thinking…which side would be more concerned about something they wrote being seen by the other&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;I think I probably say most of what I feel to my parents, but I doubt they say it all to me&quot;
**A,** i &quot;…it&#39;s whether the parents would feel more upset about whether their children are reading something they&#39;d written, or if the children would be upset if they saw something they&#39;d written…so that is I think why it does seem sort of essential to have two segregations&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…I&#39;ve seen on social media, parents have a lot more issue about when autistic people write about their experiences as children, they usually have a whole host of issues…and they then try to silence all those who can&#39;t speak.&quot;
**A, P** , d: &quot;…my concern about hearing all that is that for those who have co-occurring conditions, and find life really tough, and learning disabilities and all the rest, it can&#39;t be much of those kids they [parents] can love then, is there, if they don&#39;t love the autistic part of them too.&quot;
**A, P,** g: &quot;…the autistic person might not know unless they have pointed to the lights and articulated it, so I think it&#39;s an important point to make it clear that that&#39;s your interpretation and it could be this or that, and if that&#39;s your input then it could be created, unless that individual was in some way communicated with, and that is not just an ability to speak issue is it, it&#39;s about understanding your own issues and being self-aware.&quot;

**A** , **P** , d &quot;…I don&#39;t know how we&#39;re all responding so linearly because we&#39;re assuming the parents of other people who are non-verbal want their experiences to be entered in the same way as everybody is able - to use the &quot;normal&quot; inverted commas, thing.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…one thing that was said in the presentation that – and we did discuss this in the group, that I didn&#39;t get from the bits we scanned earlier, was that it was &#39;autistic first&#39;, but &#39;welcoming and inclusive for others&#39;, and I&#39;m thinking in reality how these sorts of things happen is the autistic people can sort of get drowned out by the volume of people who want to speak on their behalf&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…in terms of the language people use and knowing whether things might be offensive to people…my job is a journalist, and I&#39;m an editor, and I&#39;ve edited a lot of people&#39;s opinion articles, and one of the things that I&#39;ve found most useful, especially when I&#39;m dealing with people who aren&#39;t writers but are writing about their experience, is to try and make sure people remember to write from their perspective, and that they&#39;re saying what happened to them and what they think, and I&#39;m trying not to make generalisations about people or groups of people, and that often helps people to say, &#39;this thing happened to me&#39;, and, &#39;here&#39;s how it was and here&#39;s how I felt&#39;, rather than, &#39;this group of people does this type of thing to people like me&#39;, which is…automatically much more confrontational even if it is essentially trying to tell the same story.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…have a way to really emphasise to people not to make generalisations, and that they&#39;re…completely allowed to say what happened to them and what they think about something but making sure that they take ownership of the pieces that they&#39;re using, not kind of broad-brushing over whole groups of people, which is when you tend to get issues where it&#39;s sort of offensive.&quot;

**A** , d &quot;…what we should be working towards is making sure that those situations [which cause meltdowns] aren&#39;t stressful for lots of people… even non-autistic people, and to describe how they affected someone when it really upset them, in a way that blames them rather than is looking towards to a future in which that situation could have been better for them is…totally missing the point of the exercise, and…further dehumanising a difficult situation this person experiences&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;Thank you so much [A] I think that&#39;s really beautifully put and I&#39;m really glad we&#39;ve captured that.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I think there&#39;s a distinction between – and actually, [A], I&#39;m thinking about what you said this morning – there&#39;s a distinction between saying, &#39;I am frustrated at myself; I had a meltdown and I was annoyed about it – it was difficult for me&#39;. There&#39;s a difference to saying, &#39;this is how I felt, and I am sharing my experience&#39;, vs. somebody else sharing the experience.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;for me and how I understand scientific research… if that&#39;s for research it should be really clear that that&#39;s people&#39;s perspective, and whatever the difficulties of the research are, that means that you didn&#39;t manage to access the real source material.&quot;

**A** , d: &#39;…so long as it is flagged that the person who wrote this is not the person that they say they&#39;re speaking for, then it ought to be possible to have research that understands that

limitation.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…in some cases there will have to be a degree of facilitation to allow that to happen [someone who is non-verbal or having non-verbal needs using the platform], for a parent or carer, whether that&#39;s just to arrange a time and place to do that, or to make sure the correct functionality is in place.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Parents, in my opinion, should be allowed to actually say even their deepest frustrations about how they seem to be dealing with things, particularly about how their children have meltdowns and things, because I&#39;ve had that happen to me before, in certain situations in public...but to try and therefore claim that somehow if they start using certain pejorative language like, &quot;bloody&quot;, and all this, somehow excludes autistic people including myself, somehow I find that to be…false actually, because if it was really inclusionary they would be making it really clear about what they actually think of us…&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of being exclusionary as a whole&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s this slightly separate issue – I don&#39;t know if people agree with that or not, but it&#39;s around… parents and guardians uploading their experiences onto the platform, and how that&#39;s done in a sensitive way – it seems to need more discussion at the moment.&quot;

**A** , d: &#39;And on that second point I think that&#39;s a really tricky question, because obviously you want the platform to…be as truthful and accurate as possible for research purposes, but I would totally reiterate the point about it not being a place to – certainly not encouraging -venting, and I think it&#39;s a very, very tricky question about how you do that and how you balance those needs. I don&#39;t have any answers to be honest, but I totally get all the points that have been raised.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…thinking about it from that perspective [informing researchers], the idea of my parent potentially writing something about me potentially becomes less disturbing for me.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…unless we&#39;re specifically wanting to collect information…also directly from parents directly about their experiences, you know that example about [A] was perfect, because the first one was, &#39;this upset [A] because [A] got upset and that happened before and [A] doesn&#39;t like that&#39;, in comparison to, &#39;this happened which made me feel this which made me do that&#39;.&quot;

**P, A** , d: [autistic parents of autistic people and support workers posting] &quot;That&#39;s the vehicle for positive inclusion&quot;

**P, A** , d &quot;…only when we got him [autistic son] mind-mapping and putting his own things forward, right in the middle of everything, did things start to work, and I still want to explore that, so if we just say that share stories, we&#39;re doing it in the exact same way, it&#39;s just another person sharing on behalf of someone else…I don&#39;t know…&quot;

**P, A** , d &quot;No, I don&#39;t think we should [share on behalf of someone else].&quot;

**P, A** , d &quot;I think we have to be clear that this is either the views of the individual that&#39;s been helped to communicate that, or it&#39;s not.&quot;

**P, A** , d &quot;…my concern is that we are as a society so far away from doing this meaningfully, or knowing how to do this meaningly – &quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;I would say that my son&#39;s PA – if my son has a problem communicating, that his PA could sum up things better than I possibly could…even though I probably spend more time on the planet with my son. But my PA&#39;s not emotionally invested, and sees things clearer when he sees him not doing something, not being able to say what he thinks.&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…there are different tiers even within support workers, so we&#39;re saying parents, but that&#39;s probably also supposed to be support workers or people working with autistic people, and so the definition between being a parent and a support worker, that also needs to be defined.&quot;

**P, A** , d &quot;…you would have to have a different sort of moderation and a different sort of help for that moderation [moderating reporting about others].&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;I can see me reading him [my son] something&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I don&#39;t think I can see me ever doing it [share an experience] on his [my son&#39;s] behalf&quot;

**P, A** , i &quot;…so far everything has been virtual but he&#39;s [my son is] already so hyped up and anxious about actually entering [something into the platform], and I feel that on the day that he actually does there&#39;ll be this huge knock-on effect that he&#39;ll want to talk about&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;I think he [my son] might feel better if it does go towards some research, but he may be so upset about it that he can&#39;t do it totally by himself, so I&#39;d work alongside him, but I don&#39;t think I could do it for him because he&#39;s at that stage now after a lot of mentoring and help that he&#39;d just want to shoot me and attack me for doing it wrong.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;There needs to be clear guidelines&quot;

**P, A,** d, g: &quot;…too often, the way the world is, if somebody has a great difficulty communicating then their parents might jump in and communicate for them, and their support worker will communicate for them, rather than… facilitating, taking resource into hearing what they have actually got to say, and exploring their feelings about things&quot;

**P, A,** d, g: &quot;The real version&quot; [what the person with difficulty communicating has actually got to say]

**P, A,** d, i: &quot;I&#39;m lucky my son can kind of do postings himself now… he was nervous about posting&quot;

**P, A** , d, i: &quot;Other people, they&#39;re not so used to it [posting online], so they&#39;d rely on us as autistic parents or support workers to put things in for them&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think some of the discussion is not that targeted&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;Yes, we need parents&#39; and carers&#39; perspectives, because that&#39;s to do with their experience of what&#39;s happening, because they are the ones who may need to provide support, but there&#39;s guidelines on how that needs to be done&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…there&#39;s a different discussion when you&#39;re looking at someone inputting on behalf of the views of someone else, or from their experience – so there&#39;s two things here that we&#39;re getting a bit conflated.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…my short experience of doing that bit [communicating] on the part of my son, I was never satisfied with what I read back or what I saw happen. I just knew that we hadn&#39;t got it right…&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…it&#39;s not okay for parents to say, &#39;oh my child had a meltdown, and it was tricky for me in the supermarket&#39;, but they can say the flickering lights bothered them. Well, I will say - actually, unless they&#39;ve told you it&#39;s a flickering light, or communicated that, you can&#39;t assume it&#39;s the flickering lights&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…the second part of the bitly thing [the platform wireframe] says, &#39;what would have made things better?&#39; Well, if the parents say what they&#39;d do better…that is trying to climb into one&#39;s head that you can&#39;t possibly do, because you don&#39;t know what could have made it better [for them].&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…you don&#39;t know it&#39;s the flickering lights even – it&#39;s too many assumptions always made, and this is the issue…it becomes more harmful to put words and make assumptions like this, even if it&#39;s from the inside-out view – but it&#39;s not the inside-out view is it? It&#39;s what the other person&#39;s view is, and what their idea is – it could simply be unaddressed medical pain, right, it could simply be the vestibular issues of swirling that may be caused by noise…&quot;

**A,** R, _A_, d: &quot;…it sounds having that boundary between what the autistic people put forward, and what parents are…assuming on behalf of their child – how would you moderate that boundary, because it seems to be quite a blurred line?&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…it may be that the parent believes they know their child better than anyone else, but that doesn&#39;t mean they know their child, or they know why this has happened…they&#39;re still making assumptions…they may know them more because they live with them, but they may not understand the issue.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;It may [the parent&#39;s report of an autistic person&#39;s experience] be more likely to be correct than coming from anyone else, but it may still not be the right thing.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think you have to be clear – if you are assuming, based on your best understanding, that this is the case, then please express this in your writing.&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;It&#39;s so interesting, the different perspectives on this one [sharing on behalf of others], because there were some people [in focus groups] who were saying, basically, &#39;I would be happy about parents talking about their own experience, but not talking about an autistic person&#39;s experience, because then they&#39;re talking over someone else&#39;, whereas I think what you&#39;re saying is that you would be happy them supporting someone else to talk about their experience.&quot;

**P** , d: Yes, as long as they&#39;re aware of that&#39;s what&#39;s happening [someone else is supporting them to enter the autistic person&#39;s experience]

**P** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s got to be that person&#39;s voice [the autistic person], it can&#39;t come from somebody else&#39;s opinion, I think that&#39;s really important&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…what I&#39;m getting from this discussion is the importance of emphasising supporting someone else to express themselves, rather expressing something on their behalf&quot;,

**P** , g: &quot;…not everyone has a supportive family and a network of how&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;[Autistic daughter] is a very good spokesperson on her own behalf&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;There is a group of parents of those who can&#39;t really express themselves so easily, who would want to say maybe about their child&#39;s experience rather than about their own&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;some autistic people feel quite…I guess skeptical about parents&#39; ability to speak about autistic people&#39;s experiences&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;A lot of parents feel quite passionately that they do have something valuable to say&quot;

R, _T_, i &quot;…a lot of autistic people as well say that they [parents] have a lot of value to bring&quot;

R, _T_, d: What guidelines would you put for someone sharing an experience on behalf of someone else?&quot;

**P,** g **:**&quot;We&#39;re aware and we can be sympathetic, but a sad, hard fact is we&#39;re not in the mind of our own child&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;The only thing I would feel really uncomfortable with would be parents telling something on behalf of their children or telling their story&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;I know my [autistic] son would hate [me telling his story] because that&#39;s [his] story, so I don&#39;t it&#39;s my place to be able to comment.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;I think if he [autistic son] saw things like that [people talking about the experiences of autistic people on their behalf], that would probably make him not want to use that [the platform&quot;

**P** , i &quot;Having said that, that comment about the positive and the negative that, &quot;[A] had a blooming meltdown again&quot; was a really good point, and hands up I&#39;ve never managed to be consistently positive about the situation.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;What do you both think about issues of inferring what might be going on for somebody who&#39;s autistic, internally?&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…a lot of people do have fantastic relationships with their autistic family, and they are the people who live with them every day and see their reactions, but…it is their presumption or assumption of that situation, but if they see it over and over and over again, they can say, &#39;in this situation numerous times this has happened&#39;.

**P** , d: &quot;…It&#39;s about the wording isn&#39;t it, it&#39;s about how you word that, not saying &#39;I know what they were thinking&#39;, but saying, &#39;in this situation they acted like this&#39;. I know that&#39;s hard.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…sharing to some young people… can be horrendous with their families, it could be something they don&#39;t want them to know of, and having to have their families to maybe do it for them might be another reason why they might not access it, while if they had someone who was maybe going to be able to do it for them, they may use that instead.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…we all think of our families as partners but I&#39;m also aware there&#39;s a lot of young people who do not have support at all and don&#39;t have that family network, who still need support externally, because that&#39;s where they&#39;re able to get it.&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…relying on families to be benign isn&#39;t always the case actually&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…I&#39;m in a youth charity at the moment, so I see a lot of young people where it&#39;s just not accepted to be anything apart from what they think of as normal. So young people couldn&#39;t go to peer groups or parents. It just wouldn&#39;t be seen at all to be accepted, and it&#39;s hard and they just will not tell people at all, so they just need to have another outlet somewhere.&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…I could see that if you spend your life living with, supporting, caring for, or there&#39;s someone autistic that you care about thet you&#39;ve spent a lot of your life with, then that&#39;s going to give you a perspective that&#39;s a lot more than an average person…it&#39;s going to be different to their own perspective but it seems still valuable&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…I thought it was really interesting the slide where the parent can post the experience of the person, so nothing personal for them, so that sort of changed my mind a bit, because obviously my son is verbal and very able to explain himself, but if he wasn&#39;t I think that would maybe be one of the guidelines that parents are able to post, but it would be literally about an experience, not… how they felt about the experience at all, and they would still be able to input into it without their personal experience of the situation – maybe saying, &#39;we went here and this caused this&#39; without any feeling, and that may be something that would need to be moderated, which would get that side across, but without the personal side…&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…being able to recognise or think about your experience and express it in some form, in some situations it seems that the easiest route to that would be to have a parent support their child to do it, or even just upload a video or something like that, not inferring anything or making some kind of judgement – they&#39;re just showing something.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…that feeling of…a young person who&#39;s maybe struggling still having to rely on a parent, they still might not want a parent to see their artwork, or whatever they&#39;ve made.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;It might [the experience an autistic person wants to share] be something they just really don&#39;t want their parents to know about.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…[have] a more advanced user [of the platform] who is able to upload or do that for them [enter an experience on behalf of an autistic person].&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;If someone&#39;s non-verbal, or whoever is posting an experience on behalf of them it&#39;s more the situation, not [how] they interpret it, so &#39;this is what happened&#39;, and, &#39;this is how they felt&#39;, so even if it&#39;s just the facts of what happened in that event, instead of them trying to interpret that, I think that&#39;s maybe something that is stuck in it from the start.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s [alongside autistic people&#39;s experiences on the platform] the right place [for parents to get support], because I do think they need to be separate for me.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;I think sadly that [having parents&#39; experiences alongside autistic people&#39;s experiences] would put young people off wanting to be involved, especially if they don&#39;t have good relationships with their parents, or they feel judged.

**P** , i: &quot;They [autistic people] might feel that they&#39;re going to be judged in that environment [in which parents share experiences], so it might stop people using it.&quot;

**P** , d: &#39;I know my story …I don&#39;t think this [platform] is the right place for that&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I think seeing things posted [about autistic people by others] … I don&#39;t think they would work together the two of them, I think there&#39;s a separate place for it.&quot;

**P** , g: Parents of autistic people wanting to comment about the autistic person&#39;s experience shouldn&#39;t be allowed to use the platform, &quot;unless it was a totally different part of the platform, unless it was separate, because it is a completely different thing: it&#39;s their representation of the young person, it&#39;s not that person&#39;s identity&quot;.

**P** , d: &quot;for me I don&#39;t think [parents&#39; comments about experiences] should be in the same places where my [autistic] son could go and say those things, because that&#39;s him saying it, and his feelings, whereas that is their representation of someone&#39;s feelings&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;There is a place for it [parents to share about their autistic children&#39;s experiences], but I don&#39;t think it would be there [the same place as autistic people sharing experiences]&quot;

**P** , i: Sometime…the kids are brought along [to the parent group] and they play somewhere on the side, and I&#39;ve seen the reaction of some of them with different levels of autism, how they react to their parents being involved…there&#39;s one young girl, I could see her when her dad was talking at the meeting rolling her eyes and so on…it&#39;s a difficult thing because we want to help our kids but we don&#39;t want to tread on their toes either.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…if they [autistic users] were in some kind of education setting, you would also maybe have other people who may post on behalf of them so then that opens up another side, if they&#39;ve asked somebody maybe to help them post something, to get that side of it as well, it might not just be a parent who posts for people…&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…if educators could be invited onto this as well…&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I don&#39;t know how…confidentiality… would work [if educators were brought on board]&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…a lot of people in education are…so overwhelmed with everything&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…the more resources there are available to them [people in education] [the better], and maybe someone can see what an autistic child feels and how they react, and why, and if they&#39;re basically getting information from the horse&#39;s mouth, albeit via a platform like this, that can only be a good thing.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I do think that…whoever reports it, it needs to be the autistic person&#39;s story and not their [the reporter&#39;s] experience of the event, and that&#39;s the thing I think has got to come out of it the most.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…even if it was only one forum and autistic people saw it, they would still see that it was factual and it wasn&#39;t really saying that, &quot;I felt this&quot; or, &quot;oh it was a nightmare&quot;, and that will build up trust – so I think that would really be beneficial.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;It wouldn&#39;t always have to be a parent, it could be anybody who works really closely with them [the autistic person] and wants to tell that.

R, _T_, i: &quot;…in those circumstances [someone helping an autistic person share] there&#39;s issues of consent, like can that person consent?

R, _T_, d: &quot;…there&#39;s issues around, is it [sharing on behalf of others] an appropriate thing to do?&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;It&#39;s that confidentiality [that is an issue with parents sharing for autistic people]&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;What permission would you want to give to someone like that [the parent of a non-verbal autistic person]– do you think they should be able to use the platform?&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;We know young people want independence and need independence from their parents&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;We need to somehow encourage it [independence from parents].&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;I do still believe that people who can&#39;t express themselves, their near and dear ones still need the opportunity&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I&#39;ve been going to a parent&#39;s group with my wife for about 6 years now, and it got so big that it&#39;s probably just as well that we had lockdown because now they do it on Zoom rather than in their house&quot;

R, _T_, d &quot;…would you want to separate out the parents and the people with autism into different…groups&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;Yes, for me, yes&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;Yes, I would do at this stage, yes&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;- but…offer support to both&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;Right…absolutely&quot;

**P** , g: &#39;I don&#39;t know exactly how this would work, but I know there&#39;s support around, we [group for parents of autistic people] haven&#39;t met since February, but I think 50 or 60 people go every week they go on the Zoom…because…the parents feel they need to discuss.&quot;

**A, P,** g: &quot;…the people who are reporting on behalf of someone else, if there&#39;s no ability to edit after you put it in, are really thinking &quot;you&#39;ve done a shoddy job&quot;, and that&#39;s going to be awful&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;we were discussing around different sorts of users, and in relation to the presentation, we don&#39;t want it to be about neurotypical people talking about non-neurotypical people.&quot;

**A, P,** i: &quot;There might be a point of misunderstanding though if a parent or a support worker, PA [personal assistant], or whatever, was reporting constantly, because they had this preconception that what had made things better was people who are writing for comments, that they think there are solutions that are going to be offered in the number of postings and they misunderstand how the data is being extracted, so something in the precursor of, you know, &quot;why are you submitting the experiences and what&#39;s happened&#39;, but there will be people who go, &quot;oh, oh, somebody&#39;s going to help me.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s not always a parent who&#39;s reporting, and it might not be a supportive parent who&#39;s reporting, so it could be a really skewed report of something, so to get the facts it has to be a factual reporting, whether it&#39;s just a case of, &#39;we were in the train station this is what happened, and that&#39;s it&#39;, that will help, because it will tie into other people&#39;s findings&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;…some families are really not supportive, and [the experiences] they may put [into the platform] may be really counter-productive to the research and may not help at all, so I really think the emotion just really must not be in it.&quot;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;…we [the parent group] got to a place where we thought it might be a good idea to support someone else to be able to share a story, rather than to share a story on their behalf&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if there&#39;s going to be any level of somebody speaking on behalf of or even inputting on behalf of someone else, then that needs to be really clearly flagged that that&#39;s what&#39;s happened&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…to be able to have a note that clued you into the limitations of an opinion that has been mediated in a way that can&#39;t be accounted for&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;– two elements of that – make it really clear who actually wrote the answers to that, and make it easy for people so it&#39;s not just mediated by other people.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I just think people should be able to express themselves and if they want to express what they think someone else experiences in good faith, then they oughtn&#39;t feel like battered by…discourses into not being able to give that&quot;

**A,** d: &#39;it also should be really easy for researchers to understand the difference&quot; [between direct and indirect reporting of experiences]

**A,** d: &quot;…we don&#39;t actually know the experience of this person because we don&#39;t have their testimony, we have the testimony of somebody who thinks they can speak for them, and the limitation is we have no way of knowing how accurate that is.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think it&#39;s really important that the scientists don&#39;t think, &#39;well they [a non-autistic person] said they had this experience [an autistic person] that means that&#39;s true&#39;&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;It&#39;s a tricky one because I understand the argument that, as yet, people haven&#39;t found a really great way to include everyone, and if one way to answer that is we can&#39;t allow anyone to speak on their behalf, I can understand how that would hold back research that might end up bringing really useful things into the world for them, regardless of whether it&#39;s a super accurate representation of what that person would have expressed, but it&#39;s super important that people don&#39;t just take it as like a fact, that for the researchers they understand that this is just their interpretation of what they understand.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I wholly agree with that&quot;

R, _T,_ i: &quot;…certainly this is something that, when we were designing these sessions, there was somebody who I worked with and who is a volunteer who said, &#39;you need to split these up into direct and indirect&#39;, and I think that has been really helpful just having that cluster, to make sure they&#39;re not mixed.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…a few things I did say were admittedly controversial when I spoke about how parents should have the right to say what they feel when dealing with their children, especially when the children have meltdowns as well&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I&#39;m a parent but I would not feel comfortable reporting my son&#39;s opinion or my son&#39;s personal view of something because I can&#39;t&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…even if there&#39;s no opinion on why it happened, the information needs to be there without the person&#39;s side of it, because I can&#39;t say how that made him [autistic son] feel, and I can&#39;t, also say how that made me feel&quot;

## Peer support

**A,** P, g: &#39;it&#39;s to give people the language, you know, by reading the other people who can themselves write, and part of this is not just about knowing, or articulating, that you have your own sensory issues and how to pinpoint them, but learning how to self-advocate, learning what strategies can help. So, if this is going to be a very responsible platform, it really must help that side of things, as well as the other.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…one thing we&#39;re trying to push in Scotland, and increase resource in, is understanding the importance of peer support and peer mentoring, so autistic people supporting autistic people…so this could be an opportunity for the platform…to position it in that way.&quot;

## Supporting parents and carers

**P** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s sort of like that thing on aeroplanes, you know when people say – remember when we used to travel on holiday – before lockdown – when they tell you about the masks coming down, and the carer needs to put the mask on before they put the mask on the person they&#39;re looking after.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;The parents do need support&quot;

**P** , d: important to think about &quot;the stress of parents&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…I know there are parents who have it way worse than I do – I know it because I&#39;ve met so many of them, and some people really, really need more and more help&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…everybody needs just to spill it out, really.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot; I can give a very clear example…of a Mum whose daughter was coming up to 11/12 years of age, reaching puberty…quite early, and the Mum was absolutely terrified that this girl who looked like a grown woman from the outside is extremely vulnerable…not just to the sexual predator, but to any boy who might find her attractive and might want to ask her out, even on an initially innocent basis – because she had really no idea about – even all the menstrual cycle stuff she was finding really difficult to explain…there&#39;s so many issues…parents like this do need to be able to share and get support because it is really difficult.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;There are people who don&#39;t have close-knit families, people who don&#39;t have other problems…so this is a big thing.&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…that&#39;s a lot to deal with&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…right along the spectrum, it creates such pressure for the carers, and they need to be as strong as possible to provide the best sort of support to their family as they can.&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…really specific guidance?&quot;

## **Accessibility**

**P** , d: &quot;…the phrase I didn&#39;t hear a lot of today was &#39;hidden&#39; or &#39;invisible disability&#39;

**P** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s some interesting comments come through, particularly from [PA] about this&quot;

**P,** i: &quot;(R)&#39;s concern was people on the spectrum who cannot communicate easily&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…How we can actually support and find some resource to get that voice in there [people with communication differences]?&quot;

**A, P** , i: &quot;I asked him [autistic son] to find a way through it [communication challenges], and he did it by mind-mapping.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I&#39;ve learned to mind map from my son, in order to navigate things that I find too difficult to put into words, or that I overcomplicate, and so there&#39;s lots of different methods but we&#39;re not allowing it in the current form.

R, _T,_ g: &quot;Yep, I really hear that – I think one of the things that one of the things we&#39;ve pretty much decided on is it&#39;s important to include lots of routes to communicate, so - lots of additional ways of entering information.&quot;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;…a lot of research has been done around accessibility which is open, you can view it on the repository…for that precise reason [that there are lots of different valid methods of communication]&quot;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;I guess there&#39;s some difficulties around whether there is a group who aren&#39;t reached that way [using additional routes], and whether also the different ways people communicate can be examined in the dataset.&quot;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;maybe [it would be] worth doing a newer version of the platform… an improved one, to include more people?&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;It&#39;s like a &#39;Part 2&#39; [the improved platform], but I&#39;m resistant…to removing people, this marginalisation…because it&#39;s like a double removal of people, because they&#39;ve been removed to the bit where someone speaks on their behalf, and then it becomes like I felt when I was in multi-agency meetings where I&#39;m fighting to keep myself in the room, as well as my son who can&#39;t talk to anybody, he&#39;s not even really talking to me, and…I don&#39;t know what I want to say, and then it just becomes all fuzzy.&quot;

A, d: &quot;I kind of think it sounds, it&#39;s really bad to be like, &#39;oh that&#39;s a phase 2 thing&#39;. It&#39;s like saying, &#39;oh, that&#39;s difficult, we&#39;re not going to include you in the main thing&#39;. &#39;Oh, that&#39;s complicated, we&#39;ll think about you later&#39;, that sounds really rubbish to me.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;Okay, thanks that&#39;s really useful to think about.&quot;

**A, P** , i: &quot;…with the group of parents who moderate if stuff is submitted that way [in the way the autistic person prefers to communicate], cos the interpretation of it to help researchers, that&#39;s a very valid way of presenting your feelings.&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;It strikes me that there&#39;s maybe 2 separate issues, which is that, obviously, how we can optimise the platform for people who are perhaps non-verbal, have non-verbal needs can participate in that, whether we&#39;re looking at different formats, different systems and functionalities to allow that to happen and how that happens.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I have problems interpreting text [if] there&#39;s nothing visual to interpret&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I keep saying non-verbal, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re happy with that phrase.&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…there are people who are less likely to use the platform as it exists at the moment. I don&#39;t want to lock out the possibility that the parents or support workers could enable them to do it in a different way.&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;I think we have to distinguish between non-speaking and non-verbal as well, because non-verbal is a subset of non-speaking, the non-speaking – a lot of them do think and words and thoughts and understand them, they just can&#39;t control their muscles and vocal movements&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;Yes, just look at &#39;The Lost Voice&#39;, the comedian, because he scripts himself, I said never misjudge or have a preconceived idea of someone&#39;s intelligence based on the ability not being able to speak&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;…my daughter&#39;s quite verbal with speaking, and she speaks and articulates quite well…[but that&#39;s] where sensory issues is more than just the impact the sounds and the lights have, it&#39;s also your ability to interpret your own internal emotions, your ability to communicate in words, find words and what they mean, so interoceptive as well, and then you&#39;ve got alexithymia coming in, so it is hard even for some of those that are quite verbal and use their speech to communicate and articulate and understand their sensory things – so it&#39;s not just those who don&#39;t use words to speak is it? It&#39;s a whole.&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;…my son…he snapshots it [what he communicates], so it&#39;s short, brief, and it&#39;s just enough for other people to get a sense of what&#39;s going on, but if he embellishes it or makes it bigger, he would dream about – he has significant nightmares of things – and all these experiences get muddled into one terrible nightmare – so he&#39;s learned through bitter experience that share so much but not too much, because then it replays itself&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;My daughter couldn&#39;t share anything with this thing [the platform], she&#39;s very [high] anxiety and demand avoidant, so she&#39;d just so no. She also has great difficulty ever articulating how she feels.&quot;

**A** , R, _A,_ i: &quot;_So_ with your daughter then, do you think something like this she would really guess struggle with, would she able to say: &#39;I didn&#39;t like this, but I don&#39;t know why&#39;?&quot;

**P, A** , i: &#39;No, she [my autistic daughter] needs…I think she&#39;s got a development to go before she gets there [saying she struggles with something in a platform]…she was diagnosed with a learning disability, so she meets a &#39;complex needs&#39; category, and meets a &#39;low-functioning&#39; category…but she ski-races nationally. (Categories were &#39;tongue in cheek&#39;)&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;she&#39;ll [my autistic daughter] need a lot of support and learning to even be able to access or engage with something like this [platform] or even understand her own thoughts and feelings &quot;

**P, A** , d &quot;In my own experience, if I look at too much text now, I marvel that I have any qualifications in anything, because I feel overwhelmed by it&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…people who are accessing this platform, if there is too much heavy explanation of anything, how does that help the majority of people who prefer to look at things visually?&quot;

**P, A,** d: Pdf version hard to read, not accessible

**P, A** , i: &quot;I don&#39;t know how you make it inviting to them [developers] to help with this part of the project, because it does require them to acquire maybe a different type of interface or something to allow for the input of different information in different ways, maybe visual or whatever.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…I can really see the argument that it&#39;s important to do everything that we can to include people. It&#39;s just that are we realistically going to be resourced to do that better than somebody&#39;s own parent, who has found a route?&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;There were some people [in previous focus groups] who had autistic children who were non-verbal and maybe couldn&#39;t communicate in lots of situations where for many people it wouldn&#39;t have been an obstacle, and they were sort of saying, &quot;well. I&#39;m tired of my autistic child being excluded because he or she couldn&#39;t speak for themselves, and I want to be able to represent them.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I think we want to try and offer independence of expression as much as possible&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…are there…things other than words, of expressing stuff?

**P** , i: &quot;…with this parent&#39;s group I go to which is just for girls, the girls – all the little girls who come (and sometimes they&#39;re not so little) …do all sorts of arty and crafty kind of stuff to express themselves.

**P** , i: &quot;[Good for autistic people to be able to] …vocalise…in some sort of way, whether it&#39;s a video or a picture&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…not everybody has that support at home, or in different environments. We just don&#39;t have it – it would be great but we&#39;re just not that type of society, unfortunately there&#39;s just not a lot done [for autistic people with communication differences].&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…there&#39;s a lot of social infrastructure around this, that we&#39;re designing a website but really the website is in the context of the society that we&#39;re in, and so maybe there&#39;s something about how we disseminate it.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…maybe we need to talk to professionals who support maybe non-verbal autistic people, and that&#39;s a group that we need to…get on board, so we make sure that the website is really available to people&quot;

**P** , d: Yep, absolutely,

R, _T_, d: …in terms of publishing stories, having that whole range of people&#39;s preference in terms of how they submit their story, in terms of having spoken things, drawn things, written things, I think that&#39;s really good for anyone to learn about autism as well and just how diverse it is.&quot;

**P** , d Yeah, yep

R, _T_, d: &quot;It&#39;s really tricky and really important. This particular part [inclusion] is a real tangle I think&quot;

**P** , d: Yeah, definitely

R, _T_, d: &quot;…it&#39;s [accessibility is] such a complex thing&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;the designer for the project did a lot of work on creating accessibility…we made that a priority of the design work&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;[we] came up with all of these different options&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…drawing was one [option], so you could potentially come on and use your phone and draw what you&#39;re feeling, express yourself in that way&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;upload a video [was one option]&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;speak…was another [option]

R, _T_, d: take or upload a picture]

R, _T_, d: &quot;… just writing text…is obviously unideal for lots of people&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…the more things you add, the more cluttered the user interface is, and then at some point that can become overwhelming for some autistic people who find just having too many options difficult – so there was a balance there.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;… there&#39;s a balance in terms of, sort of I really don&#39;t want to imply that we&#39;ll do the, sort of, second round because non-verbal people come second – it&#39;s just that there&#39;s a core function of the platform that needs to be developed first before that can be added.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;What will be useable for research is another balance&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…I guess where I&#39;m really struggling…is however many options we add eventually for ways of people communicating, there&#39;s a whole set of skills…or abilities around being able to access the platform in and of itself&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…the need potentially to really work with whole social systems or even institutions when we put this out, to make sure that we actually can get people using it.&quot;

**P** , d: Yep, absolutely, yeah, -

**A, P,** i: &quot;regardless of whether or not you can communicate, verbalise yourself through speech, doesn&#39;t mean that you can understand your own sensory issues…it doesn&#39;t mean you can articulate them: there&#39;s interoception issues, there&#39;s alexithymia&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I have trouble writing. I can write, but I&#39;ve got a difficulty with that, so words are not natural for me: I&#39;m more music, and positions. and body language, so that&#39;s how I communicate my feelings, so once I start speaking, I struggle to stop, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ll go into a little monologue then be quiet&quot;

**A, P,** i: &quot;if you do admit some forms of editing information for non-verbal people have a terminology they would want to use, by forming it visually through images or whatever&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;Are there people in our community who we haven&#39;t spoken to yet who have the ability to help design the platform, but just don&#39;t know that it needs any extra elements? So how are we reaching out to people who may have these skillsets instead of having to go backwards by getting a new company on board and all this sort of extra smozzle that goes with it?&quot;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;…we thought also, responding to your point as well, [A], that there was something sort of about – there&#39;s a whole social infrastructure surrounding who gets to take part in things, and maybe reaching out to supporters or people with expertise to find out how to help people use this platform&quot;

R, _T,_ i: &quot;…it&#39;s about people as well about how we design it&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;find ways to make people more able to use it [the platform], and not as a kind of a nice-to-have, this is essential&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I am so conscious that I have had so many privileges and opportunities in my life, that since being diagnosed I&#39;ve been able read scientific papers and I&#39;ve sought out information where I&#39;ve had an understanding of a social model of disability&quot;

**A,** i: &quot;…while I think everyone should work towards a better understanding of this stuff, loads of people have to think about keeping a job and putting food on the table, so it kind of doesn&#39;t surprise me if some people have not had the same opportunity to educate themselves that would produce the kind of constructive responses that I think they ought to be able to produce&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…it just seems to me that those factors might combine [not having access to education and being excluded if they use misinformed language], so that the people excluded are those who have already been excluded from the sorts of opportunities to have the education about disability rights that I wish they&#39;d had, but I haven&#39;t given it to them.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…it&#39;s really important to find a way that people can give their own opinions on things, and finding a way for them to be included is prioritised, at the same level, rather than just, &#39;oh, we need to find any answers to just fill our research out&#39;

## **Inclusion**

**A,** g: &quot;we…discussed a lot about the subjective nature…the personal nature of what is uploaded to the platform&quot;

**A** , **P,** d &quot;…normally we don&#39;t have platforms like this, so can we do something to get a bit creative to increase the value of the platform to make it more inclusive?&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;I&#39;m not non-verbal, but if I was and if I was updated on how thing was going and it was like, &#39;yeah, we&#39;re going to think about you next&#39;, it would kind of probably be like, &#39;well isn&#39;t that the problem to begin with&#39;&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;I understand where this is coming from [concerns about non-verbal people being excluded or made to wait], but the reality is that this going to be a developing project, and as a project as a whole you want to help as many people as quickly as possible, so getting it out in some form quickly rather than perfecting every aspect of it, and then getting it out later, in a broad sense makes more sense.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…while everyone still gets to say their piece to the researchers, your moderation bottom-line has to preserve the ability for everyone to contribute&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…I don&#39;t know if this is still valid, considering I haven&#39;t really done research in about 3 years, but right at the start it [the presentation] was talking about how non-verbal people don&#39;t get heard as much, and as a result don&#39;t appear in research – that appears to only be discussing qualitative research, that there is far less of in autism.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I also found that there was a gap between who [autism research] was covering – more severely autistic people tend to be looked into more than more high-functioning, from what I could gather.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…obviously, if we&#39;re talking just about experience and research into experience, fair enough, but I&#39;d say that scientifically there&#39;s an overall better understanding of less functioning autism than there is of high-functioning autism.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…I think we&#39;re a long way away but if a platform like this is going to be inclusive, the only way we can say it is if there&#39;s a huge effort, parallel, into supporting ways to hear the voices and the thoughts of [non-verbal and non-speaking autistic people]&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;Yep, even if it&#39;s moving slower&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…you have to build that [inclusivity] into the resource, but it will take more time in order to do this&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…the benefits of sharing other stories of the non-verbal voices – somehow that isn&#39;t getting across enough&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;…is this not a moment to bring on another set of people who wish to volunteer their time?&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;…where my daughter is at the moment, I think I&#39;d have to say, no I couldn&#39;t really speak for her experience, because she doesn&#39;t even want to talk about it with me, she doesn&#39;t even go there with me, so it would be very much my view&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;my [autistic] daughter, despite being very articulate about some things, is not able to talk about any of this, is not aware of any of this&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…[there is] the risk of oversimplifying – sensory issues is all about…the whole bigger picture about my daughter understanding her feelings, understanding what she is feeling, putting them into words, let alone understanding what to do about it.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…when she [R] was describing her project… I didn&#39;t see the word &#39;inclusion&#39;. I put it in the chat, but the idea of the platform is to foster positive inclusion.&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…because I work for disabled co-production, we use the word &quot;truthfully inclusive&quot;, and you may question what I mean by that, and it means leaving no-one out, there&#39;s no possibility, because everybody has somebody that can help them put their voice forward.&quot;

**P, A** , i: &quot;Yeah, one thing, just, I was looking at what was sent round, and I think it was sent to us all, and it&#39;s about, how do we make sure that it is inclusive?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;How do we ensure that all voices are heard?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I&#39;ve done some dreadful faux pas, like, &#39;why is that presentation going on, why is there so much audio description&#39;, and then, during the introductions, there&#39;s someone who&#39;s visually impaired, and they go, &#39;that&#39;s for me&#39;, and I go, &#39;huh!&#39;&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…That could be any autistic person thinking; &#39;why are there so many visuals&#39;…and it&#39;s because it&#39;s got to encompass everyone.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;[The problem] may be the others…more than you…if they can&#39;t believe that you didn&#39;t do it maliciously&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…there&#39;s still this huge silence [around inclusion]&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;What I find is there&#39;s this huge…apathy, and nobody really warns you, so how do you realise and form an opinion and self-awareness?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;&#39;Mentalisation&#39; is a word that I find useful…being aware of what you can do that might have hurt someone else, and putting yourself in their shoes: if that was you, how would you feel?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I would bring in double empathy here…naturally, understanding different people come from different perspectives, and have differing needs, and different experiences, and they will approach things in different ways and respond to things in different ways – so if I put my foot in it, like that example there (PA), what I then do is just…let everyone know that I&#39;m on a learning journey, and say &#39;thank you for reminding me&#39;.&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…it&#39;s really tricky, isn&#39;t it, because we are where we&#39;re at, and now we&#39;re trying to have this thing where we&#39;re trying to give the voices of all, but we&#39;ve not actually put processes and places in society at a general level&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…we&#39;re jumping ahead into a model where we haven&#39;t built the infrastructure or…methods for it&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I&#39;m not sure what the timeframe is of this project…there needs to be research into exploring how we get to hear the voices of more [autistic people].&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…also where in this, as [A] has said, are the co-occurring conditions?&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…every person on the spectrum has got a unique perspective.&quot;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;…there might be some things that just lots and lots of people say, and there might be some things that are very different, and it&#39;s important to communicate…just because you&#39;ve met one autistic person doesn&#39;t mean that you now understand the whole autistic experience&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;I think we&#39;ve also got to realise that making this an inclusive platform is more than just including those that don&#39;t communicate through words, or who are non-verbal, but also the important role that peer groups will play, as well, so people can go on and read other,
 Become more self-aware, become more able to articulate into words&quot;
**A, P,** d: &quot;…we&#39;re talking about making it [the platform] really inclusive, but until people have an understanding of it themselves and can articulate it, they&#39;re not going to be putting it on the platform&quot;

## Socio-economic

**P** , i: &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about the sample of people who you&#39;ve got here today, but it probably isn&#39;t a very broad spectrum of class or social attitude&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;as [P] was suggesting, there&#39;s so many domestic situations which are onerous and where there&#39;s no understanding at all.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;I try to understand, and I feel bad about my inability to do that properly, but there would be many other people who haven&#39;t even got the time, the luxury to do that&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…people are struggling on so many levels, not only just this year, but in general…family groups are fragmented, work situations are collapsing&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…people I think are struggling to put food on the table, never mind thinking about what&#39;s going on in somebody else&#39;s mind, I mean we&#39;re fortunate because we&#39;re aware of the situation because it is difficult.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…how close is it [autism] to mental health? Is it a cause of mental health problems? …Well, it&#39;s probably not a result of them, but…co-morbidities are everywhere&quot;

## Age

**A** , g: &quot;…in a totally not-ageist manner, it&#39;s also very generationally based [what people would think of as offensive]&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I know that my grandfather has opinions that shock me…even he&#39;s [my father&#39;s] got different opinions to me.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;How would we make it so the differing generations could feel comfortable on the platform? Do you have an idea where you would want to strike that balance?&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;It&#39;s difficult to tell&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;It&#39;s going to be a challenging thing to do&quot;

(P, d): &quot;I was just working on another writing project with somebody and we got to loggerheads because…I was using long words and they were saying this is not going to sell if I&#39;m using long words, and I&#39;m thinking, &#39;no but the long words can be the correct words…and then we get the whole, should we be dumbing down, to catch a broader range of people, and would other people think it&#39;s childish or a bit patronising?&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;I don&#39;t say this from an angry or anything point of view, I think there&#39;s an interesting place. There&#39;s so many things to do with technology and so on these days where young people know stuff that old people don&#39;t know&#39;

**P** , g: &quot;I think this is possibly the first time in the human experience that this has ever happened…because it&#39;s always been, &quot;I&#39;m older than you, I know more than you&quot;. In many ways that was true, but it&#39;s not anymore – &quot;

**P** , g: &quot;No, not at all, not at all – &quot;

## Gender

**P** , i: &quot;…but then again you have a situation like (P)s son, my daughter – for a start they&#39;re male and female, which is a massive canyon between the two.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;I&#39;ve got two other daughters as well, neither of whom have ASD, but having grown up one of 3 brothers, and the only female I knew for many years was my Mum, there are …gender complications.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…when I mention it in front of [my autistic daughter], she gets annoyed because she doesn&#39;t like this older person&#39;s way of seeing things in a more binary style&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…because she&#39;s [my autistic daughter] young she can understand the spectrum of gender and sexuality, and all these other sorts of things, but I…because of my age maybe, I try hard, but I don&#39;t really get it, and that&#39;s another thing which I think comes into play as well&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…there&#39;s certain things, when you reach a certain age, you shut off from a more open, modern day approach.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…is that [age differences] something you&#39;re saying should be taken into account in the way that the code of conduct is written, or is that something you would put into the training?&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;I think certainly in the training&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…if you&#39;re over 35, there&#39;s some things the younger generation, in addition to the ASD affecting them will see differently.&quot;

## Glossary

###

**A** , g: &quot;I think in order for…it be clear it may offend someone but not everyone, a glossary should be present, saying &#39;ASD&#39; means this, &#39;high-functioning&#39; means this, &#39;low-functioning&#39; means this, etc. – just to clear that up with some people.&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;I think there would be a place for a moderator-approved glossary of certain terms, because otherwise somebody could be constantly objecting to the term &#39;ASD&#39; when, as of now, 2020, I think a lot of people will still use that term and will do so with good intentions.

**A** , d: &quot;I think that&#39;s [learning about others] almost a benefit of this [platform], so that&#39;s why I would suggest the glossary is there on the top of the home page or on top of the entry table, because it also gives an opportunity to educate people how to discuss these things and these sorts of conditions.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Yeah, you could even flag, like, these are the sorts of things that you could edit – like if you just change this thing, to this other one, it&#39;s fine.&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;…we discussed potentially having a terminology glossary or something along those lines to…enable people to help… understand ways of communicating and how their share sounds&quot;.

**A** , d: &quot;I think in order for…it to be clear it may offend someone, but not everyone, a glossary should be present, saying &#39;ASD&#39; means this, &#39;high-functioning&#39; means this, &#39;low-functioning&#39; means this, etc. – just to clear that up with some people.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think there would be a place for a moderator-approved glossary of certain terms, because otherwise somebody could be constantly objecting to the term &#39;ASD&#39; when, as of now, 2020, I think a lot of people will still use that term and will do so with good intentions.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think that&#39;s [learning about others] almost a benefit of this [platform], so that&#39;s why I would suggest the glossary is there on the top of the home page, or on top of the entry table, because it also gives an opportunity to educate people how to discuss these things and these sorts of conditions&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Yeah, you could even flag, like, these are the sorts of things that you could edit – like if you just change this thing, to this other one, it&#39;s fine&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…a glossary [is] almost essential…to find a different way where people may refer to their condition, and ways that are considered appropriate and not
**A,** d: &quot;…don&#39;t use the word &#39;retard&#39; for example, because probably only 30 years ago that would have been the way some of us would have been referred to&quot;

##

## Segmentation

**A** , d: &quot;…in terms of it being a welcoming place…you [Researcher] mentioned the potential to bring in children, the potential to bring in parents, letting their children use the platform, and I do wonder whether there is something around user segmentation, and perhaps treating children slightly differently. I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s possible.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I just wonder whether there does need to be a slightly different policy, or some users potentially being able to see or not see certain things…because it would make it a more welcoming place for parents and children.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;It is [segmented censorship], because…in that initial form that you showed us there is a date of birth entered, but obviously if parents are making an account and not children, um, then yeah I think if a parent&#39;s signing up, they may be able to state that their children&#39;s seeing this as well.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Does it [segmentation] mean therefore that certain things like software get introduced? Like if a parent was using a computer and therefore they logged in to the form itself, they could click on a feature that says…something along the lines of &#39;parents in the room&#39;, or &#39;parents online&#39;…and there would be circles that would get flagged up [so] they themselves don&#39;t need to see it [a particular post] as a result of clicking on that feature, and it&#39;s a better way than trying to enforce public censorship.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I…wonder whether this is actually a kind of place for a hierarchy or segregation of different kinds of uploaders, because obviously this platform was initially about non-neurotypical people uploading experiences, and obviously then we want to be getting a cross-section of the community including parents, other people in the community who have some interest in this process.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think fundamentally the priority is around non-neurotypical people and their experiences. So, I was wondering actually if you would want a different level of functionality or level of autonomy for those users?&quot;

**A,** i: &quot;…for example, for parents, more reminders could be built into the platform, or greater kind of functionality…so they can really kind of take a step back and think, &#39;okay, is this really what I&#39;m saying in the heat of the moment. or something that in the cold light of day I probably wouldn&#39;t have said&#39;, and maybe building some of that capability into the platform by nudges.&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;I still think for parents there needs to be a separate place&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…it definitely can be a separate place [on the platform] where they [parents] can do [share experiences].&quot;

## Platform design

**A, P** , d: &quot;…a facility that uses ways that autistic people communicate themselves to get their feelings out, which might be, you know, mind-mapping, spider charting, could be painting, it could be anything, but it still records that experience.&quot;&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot;…if we use, for example, machine learning to pull out themes, so basically, look at texts and take out some of the common themes to make suggestions on how to change environments…if something is maybe a video or a drawn picture, that&#39;s going to be harder and a different route&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…in that…&#39;what would make it better?&#39;, in that sometimes [people could put] tips to other people, whether those tips can be followed or not, or that they could be read ultimately by someone like London transport to make improvements – so that aspect of investment, why it&#39;s good to share your story with everyone, isn&#39;t made clear within the precursors or the build-up, so I think you need to put an extra thing in there.&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…there will need to be multiple types of delivery of the guidelines, so there could be little intro videos maybe&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;…having that multiple different picture format, video format, written format – &quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…one thing at the beginning is that you could have, &#39;are you supporting someone else?&quot; to share an experience, and then if you tick that box, you could then have a set of guidelines including, &#39;don&#39;t include your own interpretations of their experience&#39;.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;maybe there was a tick-box when you started writing to say that you were reporting on behalf of someone else, so that was flagged up right away&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;you&#39;re aware that somebody else has typed that for somebody&quot;

## **Segmentation**

**A** , g: &quot;… we talked about segmentation of users&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;if parents were concerned [they] still need somehow to get support.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;We currently came to… not really a conclusion… that maybe parents should have a separate section in which to communicate, so that people who are on the spectrum and are able to communicate for themselves can do&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Perhaps, if we are talking about subsections… people with additional neurological conditions having their own space would be great, because I often find it very hard to separate which of my issues or my challenges are caused by what, and obviously the same goes for other ongoing conditions and mental health as well.

**A, P** , d: &quot;maybe it would be a good idea to have an autistic voice section plus a non-autistic voice section.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…parents can be autistic too, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s parents [which should be a distinct category]&quot;

## **Communication strategy**

**A, P** , g: &quot;…within that thing of the two boxes that you&#39;ve got that says &#39;share with researchers&#39; or &#39;share with everyone&#39;, what&#39;s the investment if you share with everyone? It&#39;s not made clear how much benefit there is to everybody&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;I…feel that that&#39;s…a problem of explaining to people what the platform is for…that a lot has been done with the moderation process…and it&#39;s for gathering experiences. I think a lot could be done…&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I…feel that that&#39;s…a problem of explaining to people what the platform is for…that a lot has been done with the moderation process…and it&#39;s for gathering experiences. I think a lot could be done…&quot;

**P, A** , d: &#39;…the video that was done…by the actor with the experience of the tube journey, I feel that&#39;s all very well and good, but I think there should be an update…which is the experience of entering into a room, and the things that happen within a room…that actually does include all the people who are severely sensorily triggered. I don&#39;t know how that would be done, but almost the one for the tube is what I would probably expect to see about autism, but does it illustrate enough?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I did see one [a video] actually about someone just going into a room with friends, and then the party got a bit bigger, and showing them how they were feeling. It was done – I can&#39;t remember, a little while ago now.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;…the autistic viewpoint could be the dominant one on that platform, [but] that may not happen. I think the extent to which that may or may not do depends on how it was rolled out, how it was positioned and marketed, and if you do strive and there are efforts to bring in wider autistic people into the community wanting to use the platform and supporting them to do that.&quot;

**P** , d, i: &quot;[autistic daughter with epilepsy has] done a few cartoony graphics like things, showing what it&#39;s like to have an epileptic seizure. And I&#39;m wondering if there are these kind of visual representations of what it might feel like inside the body of somebody having an autistic meltdown.&quot;

**P** , d, g: &quot;there is one…she [autistic daughter] often illustrates to me, which is very easy for men of a certain age, like me, to understand, is all this sensitivity to hearing, because you know that men, I&#39;m sure women as well, but as men get older you often hear them say, &quot;Oh please stop this noise I can only hear one thing&quot;. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same thing with women, but they&#39;re probably just much better at dealing with it.&quot;

**A, P,** g: &quot;… it&#39;s how you articulate it isn&#39;t it, because I think that is when you put it out there and market it.&quot;

R, _T,_ i: &quot;The thing that I think is important is that the public posting is part of helping others learn about themselves, or about their friends or colleagues who are autistic as well, in exactly the sort of way that [PA] was saying, and I think there&#39;s maybe a difficulty that we have with this platform of sort of conveying that.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;That&#39;s necessarily clear when you&#39;ve got the public part of it…it might just be the way that we&#39;ve been discussing it over the whole day, that I don&#39;t know what the purpose of this is exactly – but it doesn&#39;t make perfect sense to me&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…if people are aware [the platform is for research] before they post, then they are more likely to think, &quot;okay, this is useful for research&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…just really emphasising what it [the platform] is about and emphasising that it isn&#39;t just a place to vent about your difficulties, it&#39;s a place to explain them.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think that&#39;s a factor of making people understand what they&#39;re here to do&quot;

## **Moderation flow**

**A,** d: &quot;I think where the moderation process has to be really clear, is you&#39;re asking autistic people to socially communicate with you, knowing that from my perspectives that&#39;s one of the things that I struggle the most with, and while not trying to break any rules I may break some rules through my weakness&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…the moderation would have to be a very clearly defined system with processes already in place&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…in the event of the platform being popular, then there would need to be a very mechanistic and structured moderation process simply to enable the flow of commentators and the moderating process to…work effectively&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…people should be welcome to say what they wanted to say, but…have a mechanism where people can understand that this isn&#39;t the place for emergency cries for help – not because no one cares, just because a semi-slow process that goes through moderation is just not the place to go for that.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;It&#39;s really great, it also helps us with the fact that it&#39;s going to be really difficult to moderate all the posts and so we&#39;re going to really need to set expectations that it might be quite slow&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I&#39;m online on Autistica&#39;s online forum, so there&#39;s a team of us trying to work around the clock, although it&#39;s live, it&#39;s not withheld, although we do approve posts and…comments&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;I know it does make it more difficult [withheld postings], and so there isn&#39;t really that time issue on this [platform] as such&quot;

**P, A,** d: When we do it [moderate], it alerts us to what we call &#39;reported content&#39;, and then we get a notification as moderators to go on that, and it isn&#39;t conditional on all of us moderators going on there, it&#39;s conditional that say two people go on, and they&#39;ll do voting, but generally on that one it&#39;s an individual reporting that they&#39;re offended by something, by whatever criteria, and other people vote. And in that we only get snapshots because there&#39;s usually lots of long threads of what this thing is, whereas we would see pretty much the entire log, or whatever it is, and then people were voting on that.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;A very good point that helps us to authorise, to moderate, is to have particular words put in that creates an alert, we have that.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;One thing that helps [with the Autistica forum] is, because Autistica becomes more and more established, they call a lot of people, so over 12,000 members in just a few years: the members are coming up a curve too to notify us, and that&#39;s what (PA) I think was saying, and I think that&#39;s very important to be built in too, because I think there&#39;s a risk&quot;

**P, A,** d: It&#39;s quite dangerous to assume that even a small group of moderators in such a new project would be able [to moderate well]: to think it&#39;s almost self-learning&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;If I was wanting to go for the jugular in something I post it&#39;d be very specific personalities, but that would be totally destructive&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;All the concrete and abstract debates we&#39;ve been having, what this comes down to, is how we do the moderation process?&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think also, in terms of that process, if it does turn out to be a fairly or highly popular platform, then that process will need to be fairly standardised and methodical, because you can&#39;t be making too many discretionary decisions, it just isn&#39;t going to work.&quot;

**A,** d: &#39;If it&#39;s lower engagement, then it might be better to have a bit more discretion, but if it&#39;s as popular as we hope then we may need less.&quot;

**A,** R, _A,_ d: &quot;I wonder what the process would be the other side? Do people want that post taken down instantly, do they want to know what happens afterwards?&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…I think it would be good to see…a workflow chart of the moderation process, because I think it would be good to work through that and sort of visualise that on a more systemic level.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think you&#39;re right: a process flow of which fields need to be filled in.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;it&#39;s [moderation is] gonna be something that develops over time&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think there&#39;s obviously a very fine balance…so I think we need a kind of fettered moderation policy, and one that&#39;s kind of responsive…it grows with precedent, and works out what does work and doesn&#39;t work, and would need to grow with time too I would say&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…a kind of written constitution then in that regard&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;It&#39;s [moderation] definitely something that needs to be a consistent work in progress.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…you could have a process where it takes your post and it…gets quarantined overnight, and that could help the fact that obviously there&#39;s not going to be a whole warehouse of moderators waiting for comments coming in…so you post it, and you know it&#39;ll go live 24 hours later so you can sleep on it.&quot;

**A** , i, d: &quot;I know many people, such as [A], would definitely disagree with me in this particular subject, you can&#39;t always police people&#39;s ability to say what they think in different situations…what offends me may not offend…and vice versa&quot;

## Quantity of posts

**A** , R, _A,_ d: &quot;I wonder if anyone has any thoughts if somebody posts, I don&#39;t know, four times a day every day, and they kind of got one voice coming quite loudly, as opposed to somebody might do once a month or every now and then, or something which has strongly influenced them: if there&#39;s a way of kind of balancing between the two to get a good level?&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think quantity doesn&#39;t always interact, or isn&#39;t always a correlation with the quality of the post&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…don&#39;t exclude anybody, people should be free to comment as much or little as thy like&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;I think to be honest if people post loads, that&#39;s great, but if they want to interact with it very little, that&#39;s absolutely fine&quot;

## Self-moderating the posts you share

###

**A,** d **:**&quot;…potentially adding little pop-ups before they actually post to be like, &quot;are you sure you want to post that&quot;, so having this little moment to stop and think&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…for me…it comes down to the devil&#39;s in the detail about how they…[human or robot moderators] can flag, filter, tag, group posts, so that people can…self-moderate.

**A,** d: &quot;I keep coming back to: in my former job, I used to write procedures and processes, and thought about, &#39;What would you need to have in place in order to categorise and censor things so that people can protect themselves?&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I always go with, if I write something, sleep on it, and still stick to it then it&#39;s probably about right. And if I write on it, sleep on it, and change my mind then I&#39;ve probably made a mistake.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;And I also think that part of it is in the sort of, nicking [A]&#39;s idea he said about behavioural nudges…trying to get the writer to not vent and just tap away and hit send, is if they have to sort of categorise it in some way, so – this is a topic about parenting, is it a trigger?... if they have to do some additional little steps, even tick-boxing, but additional steps or drop-down categories.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…you would say actually, &#39;I would rather this wasn&#39;t in the public domain on reflection&#39;, so it&#39;s still there but it&#39;s no longer publicly visible. If that was sort of one way maybe you could do that – hive it off from the public view, because obviously that functionality is already there because it&#39;s been designed that way already.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;I don&#39;t know If there&#39;s any self-editing, because when I first put a couple of things in, I didn&#39;t exactly like what I put, and when I went back to see if I could edit something, I don&#39;t think I could, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve changed it since then&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;…helps to look at other things on the platform, when people start to discuss something, I can go back in and edit it [my experience], and then I look at it and go, &#39;that&#39;s fine, I&#39;m happy with that&#39;, I let it go.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;I can always think of an example where I think I wrote something that was okay, and then somebody will point it out to me and I&#39;ll go, &#39;oh yeah, you&#39;re right&#39;&quot;.

**A, P,** d: &quot;…I&#39;ve done those Google-maps things. You preview it before you say, &#39;go&#39;, so you write it, you&#39;re invited to have another look at it, that&#39;s an opportunity to see it there, there&#39;s literally something like a 15-minute window where if you&#39;ve submitted it and you still don&#39;t like it you can go back and edit it. So, the chances of it being viewed in that time are pretty low, or less than that, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, whatever you want, that gives time for it to be self-moderated before it gets posted.&quot;

## Self-moderating the posts you view

**A** , g: &quot;…part of that [moderation] probably would be eventually a categorisation, so that people can essentially avoid what they don&#39;t want to see&quot;

**A** , g: we talked about, &quot;…potentially the way words could be filtered, people who don&#39;t want to see certain things&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I…think that…even though I&#39;m an adult and…I don&#39;t need filters… sometimes if you know you&#39;re still processing something that happened to you, you might not want to view something on a certain topic at that time, it&#39;s not like &#39;block it forever&#39;, but, &#39;just for now, please don&#39;t show me anything that relates to assault&#39;&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;One of the things that I think might help that and I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve spoken about it explicitly is being able to filter.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I can equally well have bad days, and so for me if I was coming to this [platform], having some ability to say, &#39;okay, today, for me, this topic is triggering for me so I want to screen that off&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think some of the successes of the platform will be in terms of how well the moderation evolves, allowing people to self-moderate: I can make a choice today, I don&#39;t want to see this type of post, and…I might want to see it tomorrow…in that kind of way, so that the users aren&#39;t harmed by it.&quot;

###

## Flagging comments

**A, P,** d: &quot;…potentially building in buzzwords that automatically flag [a post] to the moderators&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I&#39;m assuming users have the ability to flag something if they do find it inappropriate.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…collecting data from that [flagged comments] would be a good way to continue editing, moderation, and deciding what is and isn&#39;t okay&quot;

## Rating systems

**A** , d: &quot;…giving, in posts…U or 13+ ratings&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Potentially [giving posts ratings]

**A** , d: &quot;I wondered if, what [A] was saying earlier about having filters would help with that [moderation for people who have children].&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;That&#39;s what we have as a Google Guide, benchmarks: &#39;master reviewer&#39;, &#39;master editor&#39;, &#39;master locator&#39;, and things like that…then I&#39;ve got points: so I&#39;m level 9, chasing level 10, but then it&#39;s always been an incentive to keep me going that users can look at my stuff and they can put likes: &#39;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s relevant, but it&#39;s quite nice to see the &#39;like&#39;, or the &#39;useful&#39;, because it endorses my love of sharing what I think is useful for someone to know.&quot;

**A, P,** d; &quot;…on Amazon they have helpful/not helpful, and that becomes the basic rating system there.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;If you do that though [have a helpfulness rating] then there does start to become a higher risk of things happening, although the risk in terms of liking&#39;s lower, and with that you start to build in a level of interaction, and we do know that certain like boxes can be used for kinds of bullying and mass downvoting and things like that, so you&#39;re starting to build in a level of interaction that would be a significant – you know, a legitimate but significant step, change of emphasis, I guess in terms of the platform…I would sort of, I think it would be fine, but just…recognising that that would be a big change.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;It&#39;s an interesting point I had not considered, but how would you feel if there was a thing to say, &#39;this user sharing this experience was helpful or unhelpful&#39;, people could click there but there would be no display of either – so there would be searches in the background…those risks that you described would be mitigated, but would there be useful research value in having that.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;…the other label that we have on Google Maps is number of users that voted and number of users for review, in different milestones, so I might have a ridiculous picture of a trainer in a shop window, (I mean it&#39;s ridiculous, that many views, so obviously it&#39;s been useful to a whole load of people, or not, we don&#39;t know), but you could have…posts that obviously have got massive views, so whether you can interpret that a moderator can because the content was really, really useful, because it has a solution in it, what could have made something better, and it&#39;s this amazing epiphany somebody has had, and you could use it, cos it&#39;s like the numbers.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if someone submits a hundred postings and then not found to have breached the rules in a malicious way…they could get like a rating – a high – …because you&#39;re going to have different levels of users, and there are going to be some users who are really engaged, and some users who do really need the full ts and cs and code of conduct and best practice and all that, versus, &#39;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing again, sorry&#39;.&quot;

## Recourse policies

**A,** d: &quot;I think that it&#39;s really important in the context of this platform for there to be real, clear recourse policies, so what you need to do to report, I think it&#39;s really important that the user or the person uploading the comment has a say in some part of the process.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if there are real difficulties like that, then it&#39;s important to record people&#39;s responses for the science, but I think there has to be some kind of: &quot;we run this platform, and it&#39;s important for us to follow our own code of conduct, so while we aren&#39;t going to exclude it from the science, we aren&#39;t going to publish it publicly&quot;

**A** , d: [make it clear] &quot;you&#39;re not going to be ignored by science but, so that we can maintain the project that we ultimately own and are responsible for, we don&#39;t feel comfortable having this published publicly because we think it might, you don&#39;t even say why, but it might stop other people feeling like they&#39;re able to contribute&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;…it might not be that they&#39;ve done something maliciously, it could just be a communication issue.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…where something falls foul of the moderators and doesn&#39;t get published, the person who&#39;s written it – is there a mechanism for them to change it?&quot;

## **Moderators**

## Who should moderate?

**A, P** , g: &quot;We had a lot of questions about the moderators, maybe the sort of skills and roles and how many of them there would need to be, and what they would need to be&quot;

**A, P** , g: &quot;…it&#39;s a new type of project, a new type of thing, we will need a mix of moderators, who can learn together and also share and develop&quot;

**P** , g: &quot;…we were talking about how it [the platform] would be moderated if there were parents moderating as well as autistic/non-autistic people and how that would work and if that would work moving forwards&quot;

**P, A,** d &quot;…if it&#39;s not an individual reporting it, does an algorithm pick up an offensive word or an offensive comment in a log according to the code of conduct, or is it reliant on other people who have already posted saying, &#39;I find that offensive?&#39;&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I&#39;m a bit confused by the idea of a single moderator operating at any particular point, because any experience I&#39;ve had of moderating anything, is…a shared responsibility&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;On…my digital platform…people report things and then you have a group of moderators who make a decision whether to amend something, or remove it, or everybody votes.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…isn&#39;t it easier having two or three people together doing it [moderating]?&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…a single moderator at any one point doing it by themselves seems a bit onerous for me.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…obviously I don&#39;t have the answers…a big consideration is the sort of size and amount of comments expected, and I guess if they&#39;re having a lot of comments in, whether it&#39;s possible to have a team, or whether that would slow it down, or whether it&#39;s kind of a reviewed moderation.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I think there should be more than one moderator definitely, for various reasons, not least because this is a very new thing: the fact that this is still very subjective, the fact that…not one autistic person is necessarily up with all the potential ways the code of conduct could be breached&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…more than one mind, I think, has to be a part of that [moderation], and it has to be a group to be able to deliberate on things and share views&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;I don&#39;t know [what happens when there&#39;s a disagreement about moderation]. I&#39;ve always been able to persuade people, if what they wrote that they thought was okay and someone else thought it&#39;s not okay, to see the long term.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;Who will moderate it then? Who will be the moderator? Will it be actual users of the forum, or will it be somebody else?&quot;

R, _T_, d: Who will moderate the platform is still to be decided

R, _T_, d: &quot;How important do you think it is that the moderators are autistic themselves?&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;…I think there should always be people who have an inside understanding of it [autism], and I just spoke to (A) just before [this session] – off camera so to speak about some of the stuff from your presentation, and there are some things that she noticed that I didn&#39;t.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I think if it&#39;s closed off only to people with ASD themselves, it&#39;s already creating an exclusive club, which is not really what we want&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;we want to embrace everybody&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I would have thought a mixture&#39;s good but with an emphasis that somebody with ASD is always involved&quot;

**P** , i: &#39;…maybe someone would tell [an autistic person&#39;s] …story [on their behalf], and that might be really bad for someone who&#39;s autistic – so having a moderator who wasn&#39;t [autistic], they [autistic people] may feel somebody won&#39;t understand their story, they&#39;ll look at it from a different point of view…

R, _T_, i: &quot;Part of the way I see it is there&#39;s this balance between…resource and the ideal representation.&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot;…it would be brilliant to have a real large, diverse, panel of moderators look at everything, and at the same time that takes time and resource&quot;.

R, _T_, d: &quot;How do we find…the time and resource where people feel this [level of representation] is sufficient?&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;Would you use moderators of different ages then, is that something as well?&quot;

**P,** g: &quot;…an older moderator…may come across something they&#39;re offended by that a younger person wouldn&#39;t be…so [moderator&#39;s age] could make a really big difference actually to what gets used.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…some people will post every day, some will post once in a blue moon, but you could sort of have…I think there are terms that I&#39;ve heard before…a verified or trusted poster.&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;It&#39;s about, are our moderators autistic as well? How they would look at [an experience] differently to somebody who was not – so if you&#39;ve got autistic and non-autistic moderators, would they look at things differently in terms of what would and what would not offend people?&quot;

## Interactions between moderators and users

**A,** d: &quot;[important]…the user understands why their comment was flagged, that they have the opportunity to query that as well&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I would be quite tempted, if I were you, to say, &quot;no we&#39;re not going to discuss it&quot;, especially if you have autistic moderators.&quot;&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I just think we&#39;re talking about how not everyone does communicate in the same way, and the idea that that changes what I want to say, that may then be a chance for the moderator to say, &#39;well can you explain again to me what you were trying to say and maybe we can find a way together to help you say want you want to say&#39;

R, _T,_ g: &quot;…people might make mistakes with their language, and a moderator might go, &#39;maybe could you rephrase that?&#39;…they may be very happy to do so, they may be like, &#39;oh yes, shoot, I didn&#39;t know that I didn&#39;t think about that, yes happy to rephrase.&#39; But what [A] is thinking about isn&#39;t, &quot;there might be ones who say, &#39;no, no…that&#39;s my experience. By changing that, you&#39;re changing my experience, or cutting things out&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I&#39;m curious if anyone has any solutions to that.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…to be perfectly honest, I think it&#39;s a very important and difficult piece of process that we&#39;re going to have to put in place&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;[we won&#39;t publish publicly]…for our own reasons, which we&#39;re not going to pretend are…the perfect, most egalitarian reasons in the world, they&#39;re just what we have to do to enable this project to keep going &quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think it needs to made clear to them [people who have had comments moderated out] …because it could be really upsetting if they&#39;ve been putting all this work into writing this comment that they feel very strongly about&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;…if my dad wanted to share something, my dad hasn&#39;t read a newspaper for years…the chances are that he&#39;d accidentally use something that he had no idea was offensive, but then… if someone said, &#39;by the way, this term is outdated and people find it offensive for this reason&#39;, I can then imagine he&#39;d be like, &#39;oh my god, I totally didn&#39;t know, and I&#39;m not wedded to using it, I can totally now change it to what that thing is now called&#39;, and…you can see what he was trying to express, but equally he hasn&#39;t offended anyone.&quot;

**A,** R, _A,_ d: &quot;...and you think it&#39;s fine that if they submit something the moderators don&#39;t agree with, that will then be flagged to the person who submitted the post?&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;It&#39;s a more generalised approach to say, &quot;what could be better?&quot; This is where you&#39;d obviously put the positive in.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;What we do on &#39;Next Door&#39; is… when enough people…vote…[to consider removing a comment], usually the person is contacted and invited to amend it themselves&quot;

**P, A** , d: [when people amend comments themselves], &quot;then it&#39;s acceptable…and there&#39;s a learning process, and the person finds out it&#39;s not acceptable and maybe the reasons why, and then there&#39;s no question about that… rather than it kind of just goes, and the person feels like there&#39;s no point in posting anything else because it always gets removed.&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;Would a moderator have the right or the permission to go back to the person who&#39;s put something up, and say, &quot;look, can I help you put that in another way that we could then help you put that on the forum…?&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;[giving feedback] takes time&quot;

**P,** d: exactly yeah – it&#39;s really hard to get that right

**P,** d: &quot;If a comment was moderated though, what you could say to a parent is why: the input is really important, but you need to take the personal out of it; you could explain that the content&#39;s the really important part, but the actual emotion isn&#39;t - it&#39;s not the right format.&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…you [the moderator] might go back to the person who&#39;s put the post and she might say, &quot;no, I put that because I am pissed off with the way someone treated me at school, so I don&#39;t need someone to make it sweeter.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…because I&#39;m coming from a kind of operational thing, how many posts are we gonna get a day, a week…? While I would like a high level of touch from a moderator, is that really possible? I suspect not.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;What [A, P] and I were talking about at the very end of the last session was…moderation has been given to someone, and you say, &quot;do you really mean this, this may have come across in such and such a way? Would you like to revisit it? Would you like to amend anything?&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;Yeah, to be able to communicate that in a way that doesn&#39;t sound critical, but sounds kind of a more open process&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think what you said [A] about being able to edit changes, I think you have to be careful to show a level of transparency where changes are being made, because I think that…engenders change…without understanding the underlying reason why.&quot;

##

## Moderator training and guidelines

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I think part of the guidelines needs to say, &#39;we&#39;re not going to edit people speaking about themselves&#39;, but may put back as the moderation, &#39;if you&#39;re feeling frustrated because of the actions of somebody else, this is not the place to capture that, and here are some good resources, here are some good places where you can go and support that purpose.&#39;&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…what if you want to say something on the forum and the moderator ends up having a bias against what you write in any way whatsoever? What if the moderator decides to take… a borderline extreme exception to what you write on this particular form, so what would the process then be if you think the comment is unfair or has been unfairly censored?&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…I&#39;d quite like to generalise that question to say, &#39;how do we ask our moderators, who are human beings and likely going to be autistic human beings, to be perfectly consistent in all of the decisions they make?&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;How do we come up with guidelines to be able to respond to examples like that: where there&#39;s a disagreement with the person?&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…so there&#39;s an element of mindset there of the moderators too&quot;

**A, P** , g: &quot;…we&#39;ve been making huge assumptions to think the moderators have all the skillsets to really know when language can be harmful, or there&#39;s a problem&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think there will need to be empathy of that situation, where it isn&#39;t somebody being bad, it has to be a two-way process&quot;

**P, A** , g: &quot;It does take a bit of longitude to get an understanding of whether something is ableist or stigmatising, or harmful, or to know certain language would go against the human rights ethos that we&#39;ve come to expect, so there&#39;s a lot of getting up the curve for anyone.&quot;

**P, A** , d: &quot;I think that part of the moderator&#39;s skillset will be not just saying, &#39;that doesn&#39;t meet this, sorry&#39;, but to be able to work with the person, with a workable solution…maybe just tweaking the language … it may just be lack of experience of the person who maybe wrote the post, and without that advice on how to word it in a much better way, potentially there could be valuable input on that forum not happening.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…make understanding anger and allowing swear words part of the training…of moderators.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;that word &quot;facilitate&quot;, is really key&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;It&#39;s hard…scaling from a group where you can individually facilitate, to …an online website [which] anyone can access&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think how we view it also involves the perspective of somebody who&#39;s doing something wrong, I think that has to be empathetic to everybody involved.&quot;

**A,** R, _A,_ d: &quot;Yep, I&#39;d imagine there&#39;d be a lot of training needed around that.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I used to be one of those people that was like, &#39;oh no, I couldn&#39;t take it if someone disagreed with me, end of&#39;: I&#39;d want to get rid of them, but as I&#39;ve grown older in life I&#39;ve…got more disciplined with it&quot;

**A,** g &quot;…there can be ways for people to civilly disagree with people… and yes, you can have differences, and you can disagree with someone. and still remain civil on these sorts of forums.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I&#39;m curious how to tell apart something that&#39;s a civil disagreement that&#39;s quite polite and reasonable and something that&#39;s less polite and goes too far.&quot;

## **Risks**

**A** , d: &quot;…on balance I think it would be good to do some stress testing to see what is the worst thing that could possibly go wrong with this platform.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I deal a lot with people&#39;s worst impulses and behaviours, and it always takes my breath away in terms of how people find ways around the best thought-out systems.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…it would be really good to think about, what&#39;s the worst thing somebody could possibly do, and what&#39;s the worst thing that could possibly go wrong? If everything goes wrong…what&#39;s our worst nightmare… I would definitely advise thinking about that in terms of this platform, because it some ways you don&#39;t expect the worst, so that would be my advice as well.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think there&#39;s no perfect scenario to preventing harm or risk, you can&#39;t eliminate that in relation to this issue, but one thing you might want to consider is including behavioural nudges, so, for example, things that come up saying, &#39;are you sure you want to post that&#39;, encouraging people to think more carefully before they click send, and building that into the website, encouraging people to take a step back.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;That actually makes more sense, at any stage of the process, just literally ask, &#39;are you sure what you&#39;ve said is fully appropriate and you want to post it and blah blah blah, you know.&#39;&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;It&#39;s hard…scaling from a group where you can individually facilitate, to…an online website [which] anyone can access.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;The kind of rapid response and deterioration of other posting sites like Reddit or social media doesn&#39;t seem to me like it ought to be a kind of thing that plagues the system if people understand what it&#39;s for.&quot;

**A,** R, _A,_ d: &quot;…editing on some platforms, say Twitter for example, has caused lots of problems in terms of not wanting to change the core content of things after it&#39;s posted. So, there would have to be, I guess, checks in place so that it doesn&#39;t get abused in a way.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;That&#39;s why I think, not only from a quantity point of view I think you&#39;ve got to have it, but for the moderators as well I think you have to have some level of moderation from tick-boxing, grouping, tagging, categorising and all that, to try and encourage someone to put an effective post up&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…if you&#39;ve got everyone just dumping, even with the best will but doing it badly, then the moderators will just be drowning in it&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…going back to the presentation, that post that [R] talked about there, back in the supermarket, the first one is what you want to see, but the bottom one is…the worst version of the same event.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;The last line of defence is the human brain, I think – to protect the moderators&quot;

## Platform becomes too interactive

**A** , g: &quot;… in terms of what could go wrong I think that we agreed that there&#39;s risks in most online forums and social media platforms&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;You&#39;re sacrificing…all the social media – there are no comments, which, obviously makes it safe, but it potentially stops a marginal post, or something that might be deemed really in the fine margins of whether it should be allowed or not, it can&#39;t deteriorate as I&#39;ve seen so many other social media posts deteriorate.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be like a Reddit thread that could run out of control. It&#39;s not a message board, it&#39;s not Twitter, it&#39;s not something that people can comment on&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;You are sacrificing all the social media – there are no comments, which, obviously makes it safe, but it potentially stops a marginal post, or something that might be deemed really in the fine margins of whether it should be allowed or not, it can&#39;t deteriorate as I&#39;ve seen so many other social media posts deteriorate.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…I think that a lot of the negative feedback you can get, this site isn&#39;t going to have that – so I hope that that would move people away from the unhelpful venting.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…my hope is that this platform…it&#39;s not a back and forth.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s no potential gratification from me commenting back, so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m over-emphasising, but I wonder if this will change how people will use [the platform].&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think there&#39;s a fear with that, that people might think that they won&#39;t get any questions so they can write whatever they want as well. It has a flipside to it not having responses.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;[A] made the point about there being a lower level of risk, obviously because there isn&#39;t that level of social interaction you would normally expect on a forum or a social website or something like that. However, it would be good to test that – and I think that&#39;s down to the design of the platform.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…if, for example, the posts are…laid over each other sequentially, one under the other, but actually it could have the appearance of a forum, because people could see the comment below and decide to interact with them. I don&#39;t think the level of risk would be that high if it was properly moderated, but it might be worth just thinking about the presentation of the platform, and having a forum-style sort of responding, for example someone wouldn&#39;t like a comment and they would respond aggressively to that comment – whether that sort of situation could arise.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…you can see the other comments though: if a comment is uploaded onto the platform, you can see the comment, so there might be an impulse to respond to something that people see and don&#39;t like&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I don&#39;t know how the design will work though, because if it appears in a forum-like way: if it&#39;s set up in a forum-like way, then people might be like – &#39;oooh, I don&#39;t like that, I&#39;m gonna have my say&#39;&quot;

**A,** d:: &quot;…you could get someone going on there, posting, and some really upset autistic person could go on and say, &quot;I&#39;ve just been to a website and saw a post which really upset me&quot;, someone will cleverly find a way to join the two, yeah you&#39;re right&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;…that would put a lot of pressure on the moderators if they get inundated with that sort of thing.&quot;

## Public posts causing distress to users

**P,** d, i: &quot;…one of the main issues I think which crops up…I don&#39;t want to go on a forum and, if you like, from a parent&#39;s point of view whinge about how bad my life is, [and for] my child to hear that, and then to feel that she&#39;s done something wrong&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;…I think it is definitely important to protect, particularly those who may not naturally see those effects [of their autism on others], from discovering them, and then feeling that way [guilty]&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think some suggest that mental health issues are a symptom of autism, so there&#39;s going to be people who will want to write very personal stuff, and we were… discussing, what is the safest but the most open way to deal with those posts? and how to prevent people from reading something that is potentially traumatic and yet still making it available to researchers to see.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;[people might] …for example use different language, different terminology, have different ways of communicating, and that might be quite upsetting for another person&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;In that list of things that might be offensive, that might trigger people, I think &#39;placeism&#39; isn&#39;t there.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;People might actually mention a specific place like a day centre they attend or a particular council support or something if they…have a very bad experience, but other people could have a very positive experience of that place.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;…they&#39;re [people who are spoken about] not there on the platform, they&#39;re not able to defend themselves&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;if other autistic users or others who potentially put a post in feel…&#39;that&#39;s not my experience&#39;, [they may] feel it&#39;s invalidated because, &quot;if they&#39;ve just said all that then what can I say&quot;, and they may not even want to say anything&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…my concern would be that if somebody was in a similar situation to me: they were getting in trouble at school, they thought that they were bad, but their parents kept reassuring them, and then they come online and they find that their parents are writing something negative, I feel like that could be detrimental to the way that person sees themselves for the rest of their lives&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;It strikes me that the issue, you know, you were talking about what if somebody uploads something which is, say, for example, a parent uploading something and then…it could be quite difficult or upsetting for a child, even if it was meant well&quot;

## Responses to moderation causing distress

**A** , g: &quot;I think it could be really, really upsetting for some people if that happened [their comment was moderated out].&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…my experience was that I was dubbed as &quot;bad&quot; throughout education. You know, you don&#39;t want a child going through that and then coming home and seeing that their parent thinks the same thing, or assuming that their parent thinks the same thing because of something their parent has said.&quot;

**A,** d: …Facebook, they&#39;ve got all the money in the world, and a lot more money than you guys have, and they still haven&#39;t sorted [the moderation process]&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…I imagine that, just knowing we have social media companies, I don&#39;t want to get into the politics, but if you look at social media companies who are hugely profitable, and what they&#39;re doing around potentially harmful content, I don&#39;t think this platform will have anything near that budget to help mop up any of the genuinely unintended consequences of a potentially triggering post&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…we hope that people are going to become more open-minded over time, but things are also going to – political correctness is also going to get tighter&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Some of the experience is maybe quite upsetting.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;How personal is this going to get [the experiences on the platform]? Because there may be people who are writing about abuse, or are writing about suicide attempts. Those are then triggers for others&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if I was to think that those two people [my parents] who always could see me for who I really was, were suddenly saying the opposite, then I do think it would have a profound effect&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…my worry is that once someone makes a comment or discusses a situation…there&#39;s no control over who [or] how many people consume that content, and what effect it has on them.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Yeah, I can see that as well&quot;.

**A,** d: &quot;…the issue is if you have had a bad day, you&#39;re already stressed out, and you go onto this online platform where you&#39;re meant to be able to vent, and you suddenly see that your parents say that you&#39;ve ruined their day, that&#39;s going to make you feel bad, personally. It&#39;s not about the community, it&#39;s about the individual that will be affected by their parents saying stuff like that.&quot;

**A** , d: &#39;…if I was to see that at the age of 25 [parents&#39; frustrations], that would knock my mental health down the road, because I still feel guilty&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;Well, that&#39;s a question actually about how is the person, in particular the child, actually going to know about it? Because chances are when their children are under 5 years old [they won&#39;t be able to read about their parents&#39; frustrations]&quot;

**A** , i: &#39;I live at home, I still have meltdowns at the age of 25, but there are some people who may still be high-functioning and be able to use this site but may not be emotionally high-functioning so they don&#39;t see that effect on their family, so they could then come on this site and see their parents saying the emotional effect, but they would be totally oblivious&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;they [&quot;low-functioning&quot; autistic people] would see that, yes, it [a meltdown] meant that we had to come home early, but that&#39;s all that meltdown caused until they see that [an experience], and then they&#39;re dubbed as bad by their parents.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…if you…see that happening [people talking about suicide or abuse on the platform], would the moderators take action to make sure that person is okay?&#39; Because if someone is literally saying, &#39;last week I tried to kill myself&#39;…and they&#39;re putting that on a public place, that could very easily be their call for help, and that needs to be responded to.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I think that these are really wonderful points [about posts concerning suicide and abuse], and I think I&#39;m making sure that our process…gets in touch with somebody who is maybe looking for help or needs support.&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;My feeling is that…making those experiences [about suicide or abuse] public probably does more harm than good, and so I would suggest taking a position where we get back in touch with the person who wrote it, but we don&#39;t make that post available.&quot;

**A** , d &quot;I find that a bit troubling [censoring posts about suicide and abuse]…I understand the purpose of it.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I would imagine that there&#39;s probably a situation where the resources don&#39;t allow it [the platform] to become a kind of emergency service&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;If those things do come up [around suicide or abuse], then there ought to be an opportunity to have people express what they&#39;re trying to say, but in a position where they&#39;re not feelings right on the edge of something dangerous.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I think it would be good to…set the expectation that, if you are desperately in need of help, submitting a blogpost for moderation on this platform is probably not the most direct way of getting it.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…obviously there should be places where it could be flagged that if you do need that kind of [urgent] support here&#39;s where you can get it.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;How do you give feedback on someone&#39;s experience [taking into account] that person who said, &quot;it&#39;s my experience –&quot;?&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;[The person who has content moderated out] might just be someone who&#39;s very frustrated, and they might just say, &quot;…I&#39;m really upset, I&#39;m really angry…&quot;, because a lot of the time it&#39;s just getting rid of anger&quot;

**P** , i: &quot;…it might put people off using [the platform] again, and getting that truth again because after they have been moderated, maybe some people wouldn&#39;t do&quot;

R, _T_, i: &quot;…that&#39;s a good point&quot;

R, _T_, g: &quot;…there&#39;s so many different dimensions to a person that might mean that they might have a different subjective response&quot;

## Venting

**P** , d: &quot;…parents need to vent, in the same way that everybody needs to vent – but you need to do it in a private way so you&#39;re not purposefully making somebody feel bad about themselves.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;… one of the things that makes me feel the worst is this idea that it&#39;s the platform for venting.&quot;

##### **A** , d: &quot;…it seems really strange to me that that&#39;s the way that people would see it, and that there&#39;s a real burden on the researchers to make sure people are aware that this is not a place to come slag your child off, this is a place to research how to make things better for people&quot;

**A** , d &quot;…it&#39;s a collection of uses for research, and if that is emphasised in the correct way, I think you can avoid anger and issues like that.&quot;

**A** , d &quot;…perhaps the way to deal with that would be to have a way to direct users to forums which do respond if they want to vent and they do want to get support.&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;…if it&#39;s clear that that [venting] isn&#39;t what this site is for, then it becomes less of a potential problem I think, and for me I think that&#39;s what we need to emphasise – it&#39;s that this site is about collecting information for research, not venting.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;Yes, we&#39;ve got platforms all over the place where parents go and vent and moan, and aren&#39;t particularly compassionate towards this disabled person&quot;
**A, P,** d: &quot;…it&#39;s either going to be another platform that can fuel the negative narrative, the deficit, the medical model: the ideal…is not to be disabled, and we can cope with that in society, but disability is a nuance, an imposition, makes things less human, and we can platform that narrative too – and that&#39;s the one thing that we can&#39;t do.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;putting links to people that can answer questions, or links to actual forums where people do actually respond, is key to preventing people from coming on for the wrong reasons, ranting, and not getting any response, or whatever.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think it&#39;s really important, and it&#39;s troubled me that people have talked about the ability to vent, it seems completely inappropriate to me that this would be a space for people to come and vent&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;Thank you, I think that&#39;s really interesting, this kind of difference between policing emotion and not being a place where people can just vent – and balancing that is a difficult one.&quot;

**P** , d: &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a place for venting within that main place to post. I think yeah parents do need to vent, but it shouldn&#39;t be in that forum: the emotion should be kept out of it. There should be a place to vent, 100%, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the place for it, because I think it just becomes emotional instead of actually what you&#39;re trying to get out of it.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;How do you make a rule for when something is venting, vs. when something is just saying that you have a response to a situation?&quot;

## Libellous posts

**A, P** , g: &quot;…somebody might identify a location, a play centre or a building, or decide the person that operates within a building [has done something wrong], and criticise it almost libellously&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;perhaps you&#39;d like to have that taken out [specific places] because, for instance, I wouldn&#39;t flag out to the National Autistic Society as being awful or something, because that&#39;s so co-dependent on other people.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;If it&#39;s [a place is] named, as if you were naming someone and potentially libelling them, I think place libelling can be brought.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;It&#39;s different having a go at London Transport or a hospital ward or something that&#39;s very generalised, but if you&#39;re going after a specific doctor, or councillor, or place that you use, then that could cause a real issue.&quot;

## Vexatious or malicious posts

**A,** d: &quot;There are situations in which I can imagine there might be somebody who doesn&#39;t interact with the platform in a sensible way, or in a potentially malicious way, so they might send lots of vexatious posts or something over a short period of time, at which point there probably should be…thought put into whether there needs to be policy around that.&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;I can imagine the situation in which…you might want to pick up the malicious posts or the &#39;not-taking-it-seriously&#39; posts, so that&#39;s…one scenario&quot;
**A,** d: &quot;I think there&#39;s a way that people could abuse that if what people are uploading are vexatious, are not engaging with it sensibly, or yeah, not with the right motives.&quot;

## Posts becoming too open-ended

**A** , d: &quot;I think if you have an open to just write whatever you want, about any experience you want, over your whole life, what people are going to think about most are the injustices which inflame some of the most unhelpful responses that we&#39;ve discussed&quot;

**A,** g: &quot;…if you ask a specific question, they [contributors] might think, &quot;yes, I did have an unpleasant experience at a train station,&quot; or, &quot;when I got to university this is how I found the library extremely inaccessible to me&quot;: it might make people think about specific things rather than what is burning theme up inside in this one moment.&quot;

**A, i** : &quot;…if everyone is just writing – when you&#39;re looking for a very specific quote, like an academic in a library…you&#39;re looking for a very long time to find a specific quote. I suppose researchers are only looking for specific situations, it&#39;s going to be hard to go through all of that prose just to find what you&#39;re looking for, and that&#39;s why from the start I suggested categorisation&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;if you&#39;re talking about a particular type of situation, a type of sensory overload…that&#39;s definitely something to think about&quot;

## **Research fidelity/scientific validity**

**A** , d: &quot;…what I would take away is that, in terms of…a lot of the research, as [A] was saying, a huge amount of the research is primarily quantitative, and I think there&#39;s a huge amount of temptation to see this as someone autistic as being the subject of research interest&quot;

**A** , g: &quot;…we [A and R] were both in that thing, that slightly weird research thing, looking at the origins of autism, and the guy said it was basically like a medical condition, no different to obesity or something like that. I think that was pretty offensive and fails to capture the diversity and the benefits of autism and neurodivergence.&quot;

**A, P** , i, d &quot;…you [R] mentioned that the majority of funding does go into the science of autism, and I think that&#39;s really where the issue of all of this is, and although this is a really good step towards changing that…it&#39;s not about finding a cure for a condition, it&#39;s about finding the best possible way for people to live with it&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…hopefully projects like this will be the first step towards moving research away from just looking at the science, and start looking at the experiences as well, because it really should be 50/50&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…that is why there is so little qualitative data, because you know you can&#39;t write your opinion on somebody&#39;s biology – it is fact&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think this a great stepping-stone, but I can see we need to keep pushing for more projects like this.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I think that&#39;s another really big message to get out there…that there&#39;s more than one sort of data, and that includes the lived experience and the feelings of autistic people.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…too often…how autistic people will explain, and often their perspective, is almost discarded straight away – it&#39;s considered &#39;not relevant&#39; for data. You can&#39;t see it, you can&#39;t measure it, so it doesn&#39;t count as data.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…when I did my research, my main one thing I did notice was the lack of qualitative research.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…finding new ways to do research with people that are autistic is something that&#39;s always been at the forefront of my mind, as something that I&#39;d really like to try and get into.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…it&#39;s really exciting to see a project that&#39;s totally thinking outside of the box and taking that route that I&#39;d have liked to take, but from a totally different direction.&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;it&#39;s reassuring as well to see that I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s noticing these gaps in research, that there are other people who are thinking about it.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…we didn&#39;t mention this, but I&#39;ll mention it as part of this [sharing discussion] … make some guidance how people could input their stories that would make the information more useful for a researcher.&quot;

**A, P,** d **:**&quot;…it would be a shame if somebody shared a story, and we thought, &#39;ah, it would be so useful, if only they&#39;d included this or that we could have used it in a much better way.&#39;&#39;&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…we need to balance then, obviously the need for it to be authentic and to be useful for research purposes, but also the need for the space to be as safe as possible&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…the way that I&#39;ve understood it is that people who are gonna do research based on specific situations and specific sensory issues, in the same way a conference does for papers, will you do a call like? Like, &quot;we want to know your experiences of train stations&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s loads of different types of research, which is…what we&#39;re discussing now; loads of different research topics. Would the site have access to seeing how many people have read each post, and could that then be used as data to see what is most popular?

**A** , d: &quot;What kind of analytics are you going to get from site usage, how would maybe be used?&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…we don&#39;t have plans to implement that [analytics analysis from site usage] just yet, because…there&#39;s a whole set of other ethical questions that come with [surveillance analytics]

R, _T,_ d: &quot;there&#39;s also a big element around, &quot;what does it mean to be popular?&quot; …just because something is popular, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it&#39;s the most important thing, so I think that I would personally say that&#39;s out of the scope of what we are trying to achieve with this project.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…I very much hope that people will want to extend it and work on it in different dimensions, and be able to take that advantage forwards&quot;

**A,** d **:**&quot;…because this is a research platform as well, a lot of the information that is collected will need to be…accurately representative of how people are feeling and some of the experiences that they&#39;ve had.&quot;

**A,** d **:**&quot;it&#39;s supposed to be a…scientific project that gathers people&#39;s real experience…to censor that stuff because it&#39;s difficult to read, also means that you&#39;re then removing what is also a real part of people&#39;s experience, and that – even if it might be difficult - doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s good science.&quot;

**A,** d **:**&#39;…as (A) said, if this is a scientific project about potentially trying to capture this information. It&#39;s undermining the scientific rigour of it if people are just talking about the birds and the flowers outside…&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I can see why doing [posting] stuff that is excessively sensitive may not be honestly a good idea, but if we&#39;re still trying to find a focus on this idea that it all has to be available to research, for example, an archive section available only to researchers, where blogs that weren&#39;t allowed to be posted for moderation are still accessible, would resolve that issue. I mean they would all still be on the system…so making it only available for researchers would mean that users wouldn&#39;t get upset or triggered, but it would still be able to be used for good.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;It&#39;s quite nice that you said that [about non-public posts still being accessible to researchers], because that is actually part of the design of the system…people can choose to either share their experience just for research purposes so it doesn&#39;t go public, or they can share their experiences publicly, and actually if they want to they can say, &#39;I only want to post it publicly, I don&#39;t want it to be used for research&#39;, and I think that&#39;s catering towards people who have a mistrust of researchers but want to keep in touch with their community.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…what I really like about where this conversation is gone, is that if we keep for research purposes posts that did not pass moderation, it allows us to reflect on the difference between the posts that do and the posts that don&#39;t, and we can sort of loop back to what (A) was saying earlier, that we may have to change our moderation processes as we go along, but if we&#39;re making sure to keep the ones that we don&#39;t post publicly, that allows us to do that process&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;The majority of it [autism research] is quantitative, which is statistics.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…studies tend to look at one community of people…with particular skills and not another. So, there might be a lot of research into people with complex needs, but they don&#39;t tend to be doing the same things or being part of the same studies as the studies that look at autistic people that can engage more broadly with the world – &quot;.

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…with our perspective as researchers, we would like to build a project that doesn&#39;t exclude either group [those with and without complex needs] – so that actually people can engage with it very broadly – and we may not succeed but I think the goal is to try the best we can…&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;…that&#39;s a good clarification and something that excites me to be honest&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;…with qualitative stuff, and…there was an example about making the transport network more accessible…are the answers not going to be quite different for people who have low support needs and people who have more complex support needs…so wouldn&#39;t it make sense to have…different studies?&quot;

**A** , d; &quot;…why would you have to shove everyone in one [study], so long as you were making sure you were looking out for both groups of people, or multiple groups of people?&quot;

**A** , i: &quot;I suppose that probably comes down to funding [why you would address different groups in one study], like if you&#39;re trying to look at both that&#39;s probably going to come down to funding to do two separate research [projects] on one topic&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…where you draw the boundary between the two studies [about people with different subtypes of autism] is a bit of a very artificial separation, and it&#39;s missing the complexity of this constellation, these…multiple dimensions…and so having the researchers choose a separation is potentially quite an artificial way of customising projects&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;…if we can&#39;t find a way that works for everyone, we may end up doing something like that [breaking up the study]&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a foregone conclusion that separating people into two separate studies is easier to do.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I think if you&#39;re researching a specific area, then you need to be able to find just what&#39;s written about that specific area – &quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;While you&#39;re doing this platform, investing in all this, use it for the maximum possible, so it&#39;s giving qualitative data to the researchers and providing a good forum for autistic people to understand about strategies as well.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;It&#39;s very important to not just say, &#39;tick an autistic or non-autistic&#39; box: [it] has to be autistic, formally diagnosed, or self-identified, otherwise the research information is not very useful.&quot;

**P, A,** d: &quot;So this case, even the one the autistic person has drafted, the way the researchers read it, &#39;flickering lights is a problem&#39;, and yeah it&#39;s true flickering lights [are] often a problem, but we don&#39;t know that here. Okay, you can always jump into the most likely answers as an explanation without actually knowing, so it would throw out the research terribly even if the autistic person is speaking for the other person, you know for them…&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;so that is a point of the platform, that we collect together lots of things and we&#39;re able to reflect commonalities and differences&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;I do fear that we are trying to create two projects in one. And that the content for one may not be the content that others would post for the other.&quot;
**A** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s either the public, and research does not quite tie together perfectly, and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just the articulation or that&#39;s just the stage that we&#39;re at with the project or what, but I think that something&#39;s missing if that is going to work.&quot;

**A, P,** d: &quot;I think an information collection/sharing position that this information is being used for research, but why just keep it for the eyes of the researchers…it&#39;s akin to an autistic blog in a way&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;The thing that I wanted to maybe just dig into a tiny bit more is: …we did talk in a different breakout room about the fact that this platform is for research.&quot;
 R, _T,_ d: &quot;…[PA], I think that you articulated really beautifully why the point of the platform is not just to send experiences to researchers who will, over in their own space, do something with it&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…at least for me, I think, avoid those negative discussions that we were talking about previously in our previous groups…the idea of really emphasising what this platform is for isn&#39;t just venting, it&#39;s for research.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…you&#39;re obviously going to have a free text field at some point, where people can put whatever they want out of their brain, and I don&#39;t want to moderate that at all, because I think that it defies the purpose&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…asking both the person who&#39;s writing it, and the moderator, to go, &#39;what&#39;s this about?&#39;&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…you worry if you&#39;re too specific, every comment is unique and there&#39;s no pattern, whereas if you can just pitch it at the right level whereby – and again this will be, I imagine by trial and error, but you get to a point where you can start aggregating different comments by different types, which is what the researchers are trying to do, to pick out common themes, you know, what&#39;s troubling people.&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;…if the point of the research is so that it can go to people like the transport network, then it&#39;s less important how someone&#39;s meltdown felt [to you] or how it affected your day or whatever, and it&#39;s more important to think about, how do train stations be different so that this is less likely to happen, or easier for everyone to cope with if it does happen?

**P** , d: &quot;…particularly for research…it needs to be the facts&quot;

## Sensory processing research

**A, P** , d: &quot;They&#39;re [people online] claiming autistic people&#39;s responses to sensory difficulties are learned and behavioural.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;It&#39;s a huge, huge, issue, not helped by the fact that the ICD 11 doesn&#39;t even mention sensory, so when the DSM 5 came out, it did mention it, not as a core criterium of autism because non-autistic people can have sensory difficulties too, but to acknowledge that there may be sensory differences and that might give rise to repetitive behaviours and things need to be a certain way, but that wasn&#39;t even in the ICD 11&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;[not being a criterium in the ICD 11] fuels the lack of empathy and understanding as well, so projects around sensory issues are really, really important to garner that kind of understanding.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…the sensory was highlighted as a priority by autistic people. Is this the one type of research happening, or is there other research looking at the more biological aspects of it?

**A, P** , d: &quot;…there&#39;s a link between potassium and sensory overload in some people&quot;

R,_T,_ d: &quot;I could answer very quickly that there is a lot of funding that goes towards looking at the biology of autism, including sensory processing, so that actually tends to be where resources are directed, is the biological aspects of autism&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;It was sensory specific, because I&#39;m quite aware that a lot is going into looking for the autism gene, the very elusive autism gene?&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…there are studies on the biology of sensory processing, and there&#39;s quite a lot of lab-based studies as well…what it&#39;s really missing is how it impacts on people&#39;s day to day lives and told from their perspectives.&quot;

**P, A,** d &quot;…is this it? Sensory is one of the key problems…is this the answer or is there anything else going on about it as well? For example, understanding maybe the biology about it?&quot;

**A,** R, _A_, d: &quot;There is a lot of ongoing research about sensory issues beside this project&quot;

**A,** R, _A_, d: &quot;…when someone says…&#39;put your panic on a linear thing, 0 is no panic, 10 is panic&#39;… that&#39;s just on a line, if you put that as a body, where does that panic start, where does it move to, does it go back, does it journey – I think that&#39;s more meaningful. You know, a lot of researchers or psychologists often put this thing of measurement in these lines, and you know that kind of thing and temperature things and whatever. Because we&#39;ve got this weird thing of the weirdly wired brain and the body that lets us know that we&#39;re in distress, it&#39;s how you marry the two in a way that people can relate and go –&#39;well I&#39;m experiencing this. This is happening in this part of the body, and that&#39;s happening there –&#39;.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…there are aggressive fields out there on social media that are claiming they&#39;re [sensory processing differences are] not even real.

## **Research Methods**

## Process

R, _T_, d: &quot;I encourage everybody to write things down&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;I want to finish for lunch on time because it&#39;s a big day that you&#39;re spending with us so I want to make sure we can keep you fed and rested.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;[R]]&#39;s great December is going to be to transcribe the workshop and to transcribe the breakout rooms that we had, so thank you to R that&#39;s going to be a lot of work, she&#39;s going to listen over and over to make sure she has your comments captured – and probably in the new year: it takes a while to do the transcriptions, we&#39;ll circulate summaries, so we try to anonymise some the quotes, so you&#39;ll probably recognise yourself but you other people shouldn&#39;t be able to recognise you, and we&#39;ll give them to you for review, so you&#39;ll be able to review that so if there&#39;s anything you do recognise and you think is inaccurate or that you don&#39;t want to be made publicly available, and then after that our work is to keep on keeping on keep building the platform and keep on embedding the some of the ideas, the warnings, the suggestions that you&#39;ve given us into building the project, so thank you.

R, _T,_ d: &quot;Let me mute myself… if you raise your blue hand, I&#39;ll try to make sure I bring you into the conversation.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &#39;…the reason we&#39;re mixing this group up is that we&#39;d really like all of you to talk with each other, so each room should have at least one parent in it, you&#39;ll have autistic adults in it, and we&#39;ll really dig in hear into where there might be tensions&quot;

**A,** R, _A_, d: &quot;First to apologise, there might be some background barking, I will try to stop it as soon as possible after it starts&quot;

**A,** R, _A_, d: &quot;I&#39;m not so used to this, I&#39;m working from home&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &#39;…so for previous discussions and what I&#39;ll do for this session as well is put direct and indirect next to every quote to say; if you&#39;re taking about, &#39;this is my experience&#39;, or &#39;my point of view&#39;, or &#39;my preference&#39;, then that would go under &#39;direct&#39;, but if it was something like, &#39;this is what my son would want&#39;, or, &#39;this is what autistic people like&#39;, or something like that, then it would be indirect – so it just carries a different weight.&quot;

###

## Feedback

R, _T_, d: &quot;…I had to certainly cut our discussion [autistic group] short&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;...I don&#39;t have a lot to say, to be honest, about what the takeaway is, I think most of the points have definitely been summed up&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;That&#39;s great, so you feel that you&#39;ve had your views reflected and you&#39;ve had a chance to say what you wanted to say?&quot;

**A** , d: &quot;Yes, I do&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;…I actually thought it was really useful to hear everyone&#39;s opinion, and how differently everybody is coming at it&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;I think it will be difficult to try and get everyone&#39;s input, try and make sure that everyone&#39;s voices are heard&quot;

**P,** d: &quot;I&#39;ve found it really useful today. I&#39;ve really enjoyed listening to people&#39;s different stories and seeing where it&#39;s gonna go&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;I am feeling like this has been such an amazing discussion&quot;

R, _T_, d: I&#39;ve learnt so much, and I think that the way of approaching the solutions to this really complex problem - to be honest I&#39;d got into a bit of a tangle thinking, &#39;wow, how do I balance all these things.&#39;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…just hearing people empathise with each other and coming up with solutions, I now see actually quite a lot of routes forwards based on people&#39;s ideas.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;…just having this conversation available for research, I think just that in itself is wonderful because there&#39;s so much here. So thank you very much for sharing things, it&#39;s been really, really brilliant.&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;I think it&#39;s the coolest part of the whole project has been being able to have these conversations. I&#39;m very, very grateful for the advocacy that you&#39;re doing in your communities and the people you&#39;re supporting every day, and I&#39;m really grateful for your time…thank you so much to RA&quot;

**A** , R, _A_, d: &quot;I had a really great time talking to you all&quot;

R, _T_, d: &quot;The project is a huge project, it&#39;s a massive piece of work, but it&#39;s nothing without these conversations and your very candid, kind thoughtful and empathetic input, so thank you everyone&quot;

## Participatory science and impact

**A, P** , d: &quot;…this helps me to cross-fertilise into what I&#39;m already doing as a disabled co-producer with my council. We have a new civil campus, which was made by a disabled design team, and I represent neurodiversity on it.

**A, P** , d: &quot;I don&#39;t have necessarily mention autism all the time, but people have learned how I interact, and sometimes I come off camera, and I learned how to interrupt a presentation to say, &#39;why have you put that in red?&#39;, &#39;why is that there?&#39;, &#39;why is this not there?&#39;&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;We&#39;ve been put forwards for awards…because we were there right from the beginning, stage one, through to the build: so I interviewed contractors, inclusive architects, and I helped to find products, and all sorts of different things that I never thought I would do this time last year.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;…one of the [people] I&#39;m working with this year is doing a presentation to a European group of architects who want to know more about how disabled people have advised on disabled inclusion for building design.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I&#39;ve even managed to get basins with no mirror behind it in all of bathrooms in all of the new town halls to cover people who are OCD, body dysmorphic, so they don&#39;t have to see themselves washing their hands umpteen times, or leaning across to put on makeup using my mirror. And I didn&#39;t have to do too much explanation of why there shouldn&#39;t be huge mirrors everywhere.&quot;

**A, P** , d: &quot;I think it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been doing this with Alan Turing and Autistica, that I&#39;ve actually felt empowered to say the reasons why I&#39;ve given that advice, and listening to other people&#39;s stories. So, the story telling&#39;s really important.&quot;

R, _T,_ d: &quot;I&#39;m so glad to hear that A, and it&#39;s exactly that, being able to say directly to people &quot;this is what will help the situation&quot;, and I&#39;m so glad they were listening to you, and you were able to have that impact, that&#39;s really, really great&quot;

**A,** d: &quot;I was supposed to be part of a similar group at university, and they didn&#39;t listen to a single word we said!&quot;

**R,** d: &quot;That sounds wholly unideal, hopefully we can do a lot better.&quot;

Platform - purpose

A, P , g: "…with this potential…really powerful source of information, we've identified certain things we could do to optimise the use of it"

A, P , d: "…what I feel is very important about the whole project today…is that sensory differences, even though there's research out that says its prevalent in up to 90% of people, it's still very under-addressed and un-empathised with"

A , d: "…because people are able to express themselves in tons of different places, like blogs or whatever, and you've just flagged some of the issues about people who just take stuff off social media or whatever, would it be a situation where you could put a call out and say, 'if you've written about this on your blog or whatever you could just copy and paste it'"

R, d: "…I think people would be allowed to self-plagiarise. I think people could copy and paste their own stuff onto there and that would be fine. But I think a call for specific experiences - I don't think we've thought about that specifically. I think there's a lot of steps before we get there"

R, d: "I think this idea of getting people's stories as people go about their daily lives is both to give autistic people a platform on which their voices are heard, to educate non-autistic people that this [sensory processing differences] is a really thing, and really what matters is someone else's experience."

A, d: "I would be concerned if people were understanding that it's all things for all people – it's for a specific purpose, and therefore you will have lines that just can't be crossed, and that's okay if you want to go and put it elsewhere, but you need to maintain an ecosystem, that's how I would approach it."

A , d: "It doesn't seem to me to be like a Reddit thread that could run out of control. It's not a message board, it's not Twitter, it's not something that people can comment on"

R, T, g: "…one of the things that's come up is, there are lots and lots of places for autistic people and parents of autistic people and autistic parents of autistic people, there's lots of places for people with complex needs to share their experiences – you can go on blogs, you can look on other social media platforms, forums and so on…some of those [platforms] are used for research, but they're not often used for research, so a lot of times the experiences that autistic people have don't actually make it into the knowledge, into the minds of people who can change things"

R, T, d: "…unfortunately, for rightly or wrongly, blog posts don't carry as much policy making emphasis as a research paper"

R, T, g: "…there's a bridging aspect of saying that there's all of this knowledge that's not getting into the minds of probably neurotypical people, who probably don't understand the diversity of experience"

A , d "…for me at the moment I feel like it is almost unclear what is the main purpose of this platform - because I've seen the communities that are online, I don't think it would be needed to vent, and I don't really understand why people would feel the need to use a brand-new platform to do so"

A , d: "That's the issue of giving people the right brief…even just a really simple example of that, and trying to engender a sense of…what's useful for research and describing what happened, rather than why it made you feel a certain way, is maybe more useful"

A , d :"It has to be emphasised that that is what this is – it isn't a site to let go of your feelings, it's a site to inform us about your experiences"

P, A , d: "When I first looked at the stuff that was sent around briefly, my first comment was, "hey, this needs to be a platform for autistic people to also become more self-aware about sensory"

P, A , d: Autistic people offer each other, "peer support type thing and mentoring…I think that has to be a real… key part of this forum, and I think that has to be really up there"

P, A , g: "Where we see a [in]…a lot of autistic communities money going to non-autistic organisations to support the autistic person".

P, A , g: "What we're not seeing is the effort and resources for autistic people to support themselves, and provide peer support and mentoring, from those shared experiences"

P, A , d: "This would be a real missed opportunity if it's [the platform] not achieving that [creating self-awareness] as well. It's peer support, sharing strategies.

P, A , d: "That [sharing strategies] was mentioned in the presentation, but that emphasis didn't come out in the…bits I'd scanned quickly before the meeting."

P, A , g: "…by doing that [sharing strategies] and sharing with other people it helps autistic people, but also others who have relationships with them: so families, communities, schools…"

P, A , d: "…because we don't have an interactive element…like on the Insight Facebook page, I would have thought that this was data collection and research first and foremost, and that ultimately when it came to a certain point, then someone might be tasked with the responsibility of extracting what was useful to – I don't know, form the basis for peer support."

P, A , d: 'I just wanted to make a general comment on…everything here – we talk about…the current thinking is autistic voice first, but welcoming all voices related to the community, but I'm thinking, the autistic voice is always the minor voice in terms of number…so it may not be balanced on there."

P , g: "…obviously the emphasis, the priority has to be the people on the people on the spectrum, I don't think there's any doubt about it."

R, T, d: "…it's not a social media platform, you're not responding to it, it's not a forum, it's not where you have conversations with people, but it is supposed to be useful in terms of seeing what other people are experiencing and maybe seeing yourself in some of those"

A, d: "I've been blogging for 9 years, and I'm on multiple communities online…I won't deny when I started working with young reps and they said, 'yeah is that necessary, there's information sits everywhere', and now that I've seen it I'm like, 'oh man yes this is perfect', so it might just be that I can't visualise it yet, but it might just be the whole iPad situation where you don't think it's necessary and then everyone needs one"

A, g: "It makes sense that this is an information collection site…and I think that's kind of how it has to be known almost because…there are people who want to come on for answers, and there are people who said that in the previous group as well"

A, g: "I just think there are so many other platforms where people already go for support, you know, you've already mentioned Twitter, Instagram and Facebook…"

A, P , d: "It's information about sensory processes, not support"

A , d: "…it's not a chatroom, it's not a Reddit thread"

A, d: "…it seems to me that the burden is on the researchers to really set out at the beginning what this [platform] is for – and constructive contribution's helpful"

A, d: "…it seems to me that that is what this kind of research is useful for – the people using it should trying to be building solutions, and it doesn't matter how upset someone's parents are, or how embarrassed they were in a society that doesn't understand or respect different people – it's immaterial. The point is you just have to…support their needs better, it doesn't matter how anyone feels about it."

P , d: "I agree"

A , d: "…if I was a researcher and I particularly was interested in the experiences of autistic people and how it could be better for them, then I would be super interested in prioritising those [autistic] voices"
Motivation to take part

A , d: "[When] I write it helps me process, and every time I write something difficult, I write it with the mindset that if one person reads it and thinks they're not alone, or that they can cope better with their issues, then I achieved something."

A , d: "I never write anything just for me, and although personally I've never reached that point where it would flag up concerns, I feel having it available. perhaps in a more secure part of the site, could be beneficial to a broad amount of people."

P, A , d: "[sharing own stories is] why I felt more connected to the community, because I was reading blogs of non-speaking autistics, and how I became aware was not necessarily having an interaction with anyone, but reading what they had written."

P, A , d: "I think it's just a different way [sharing experiences in writing], I suppose…it might be appealing to more people, more autistic people, because they have no expectation to talk or interact."

P, A , d: "Perhaps we'd better put a description…where people would tick the box and maybe share it with the researchers and not share it with anyone else, or, you know, they might not, they might have done that based on poor experience of people sharing if they've put it before, so maybe there should be a description of the benefits for people, what can we gain from it, so if they read that, they'll go, "oh right, so instead of being nervous about sharing it with other people I'll just tick this box".

P, A , d: "I talk about this [platform] being a kind of mentoring as well for autistic people to autistic people, because I didn't even have a clue I had sensory issues, and it's not until recently that I started to think, well, 'Why do I feel dizzy?', 'Why do I feel staggered?', 'Why am I feeling like this?'. I'm already 13 years past diagnosis, and it's only now that I'm realising, which I do, – 'ooh, it's a sensory thing', I'm sort of feeling sick now or light-headed or staggering or not well, you know, but I didn't even know that before."

P, A , d: "…there's a lot of probably educating people on this platform as well about sensory issues"

P, A , i: "…my son hasn't put anything in it yet [the project], although he knows that I have, and he goes 'what's the point of it?', 'what will they do with it'?, and I think that somehow or other the endgame will qualify how some people will stay with the process and even report on behalf of somebody else: What's the game? What's the thing that will happen?"

P, A , d: "I think just people sharing their own story is very powerful"

A, P, g: "I wouldn't want this platform to oversimplify what sensory issues are for autistic people…It's not a matter of 'it's light or sound'…therefore we can put our glasses on, or put earphones on, and then "whoopdie-doo", all solved"
Diagnosis or original awareness of autism

A , d: "I've only been recently diagnosed in the last couple of years…back when I got to the age of about 40…so I've been going up a learning curve pretty quickly,

A , d: "I got diagnosed at 32, so it was a mystery for most of my life why I was so different and why I was so strange to other people"

A , P, g: "…just having a diagnosis doesn't help you immediately be more self-aware about who you are, your needs, or strategies to help yourself"

A , P d: "I wasn't diagnosed until 62"

A , P, d "It's an aspect of dyspraxia, I'm still waiting to be assessed, but there's people who have actually had their co-occurring and co-conditions already assessed"

P , g: "…we knew about [autistic daughter's epilepsy] much earlier, we actually didn't know she had autism…until she was doing her GCSEs"

P , i: Daughter's diagnosis was 9 years ago [when she was 16], and she is 25 now

P , i: "…my son was diagnosed when he was 4, so really early, actually. The school noticed when he was young, when he was only in reception class."

P , i: 'he [autistic son] was diagnosed a week before his 5th birthday."

A, P, d: "I've been 12 years diagnosed now, and it's only been from reading the work of other autistic people having to do with sensory issues, I had no clue before."

A, d: "…I found out about sensory difficulties within a year of my diagnosis, and it's only in the past – nine years on – that I've begun to discover how I can work with them"

A, d: "I didn't get diagnosed until I was 40 and I held down a decent job and nobody knew, me included."

A , g: "It's more often than not that people just don't quite have the right kind of guidance [when they first learn about autism]"

A, i: "…they [my parents] found out the hard way"
How should we think and talk about autistic people and autism?

A, d: "I think also emphasising that there are 2 phenotypes would be useful – because that's why I use that term ['ASC'], because my official diagnosis is 'Asperger's syndrome', but as soon as I say it, it comes with connotations I don't meet, because I'm female…so I've never felt that is my diagnosis, so I would rather say straight out I have 'high-functioning' autism. or I'm on the autistic spectrum, than tell them I have Asperger's and have them immediately think that I'm Sheldon Cooper."

A, d: "I think that you've raised a really good point [about the importance of terminology]."

A, d: "…what is considered to be offensive to others… is a matter of terminology as well"

A, d: "…obviously all of these conditions come with lots of different terminology."

A, d: "I personally refer to myself as having ASD, but I know we're no longer using that term in education anymore, as my teacher once told me."

A, d: I know that there's a lot of terminology…and I've met people who don't like certain terms.

A, d: "[I've met people] who don't like the "D" ("disorder) … of the 'ASD'."

A, d: "Yeah, because it's not a disorder, it's a condition. I think they call it 'ASC'…"

A, d: "I think for me, speaking personally, I don't really mind [about terminology]."

A, d: "I find it more distracting getting caught upon what some people think is less important, you know, the technical definition. I get distracted from the point I was actually trying to make."

A, d: "I use that term ['ASD'] about myself, so I'm not being disrespectful."

P, A, d: "[In co-production group]…we always invite comments, and…when I do my representation for building design, I do such a broad stroke, I do every single neurodiversity plus other people."

P, A, d: "I think…we need to go that route [broad neurodiversity] more"

P, A, g: "I don't like the way that [R] was positioning it, that people have different experiences of their autism… people's autism is very different for them, when actually they're autistic people with different experiences"

A, P, d: "…the other point we had was about autism: does your autism give you more trouble in this area or not, or people have different experiences about their autism, and I think that really puts people's autism as a discreet part of them, whereas really it's experiences of autistic people."

A, P, d: "That may be with co-occurring conditions, it may be with sensory issues or anything like that, so it's important to get that right, and it may be with the literature…I think it's not 'experiences people have of their autism', it's 'experiences autistic people have." A, d: "Or 'experiences people with autism have"

A , d: "I sort of think if myself as coming in thirds…"

A , d: "…it's difficult to say this, but you can't actually force change on society around you, and that's why I've been forced to learn over the years growing up"
Experiences of sensory processing differences

A, P , g: "In my co-production [group] we have people who just say 'sensory triggers', because we've got a whole lot of people who don't want to go for any form of diagnosis, but they recognise that [in] certain environments there's always auditory triggering, there's visual triggering, etc.

P, A, d "…I shouldn't even be on the planet, I have no spatial knowledge other than crossing the main road. Every other road that exists – it's there in periphery vision…I'm still in my head, I could have been knocked over umpteen times passing side roads with zero awareness of where I am… I'm just moving… along this road with no sense of when there's danger, it's just – you're there but you're not there. So then if you complicate that by not being able to express it, then, I mean how are we ever going to improve environments and make it safer for people to move around?"

P, A, d: "I've absorbed information before my diagnosis by a mixture of visuals and responding to things that other people have created"

P, A, d "I find my ears sometimes are listening down across the side round and my eyes are absorbing information around here, and I'll stop and realise I didn't even look around."

P, A, d "Yes, yes, precisely!"

P, A, d: "…but you can't always stay indoors, you need to go outdoors, whether assisted or not, and to go to different places, and do different things, so I don't know because we're doing it sort of forward-looking in one direction only, and I don't know how else to describe it."

P, A , d: "I wasn't even aware of sensory issues and what that meant, so I think there's this huge piece of education, and so it would be to share that aspect [knowledge about sensory differences]"

P, A , d: "[I would want to share] so people don't think, 'oh I just need to know if they have sensory issues to light or to sound'. It's not quite like that, there's a whole other aspect"

P, A , d: "…we have a consultant doing work with people on this estate, and they've done a wallpaper presentation of stick people that look frantic, when they put the other information across this wallpaper, I'm screaming, 'please can you take out some of the wallpaper or reduce the stick figures or something', it's too busy for me to understand the text."

P, A , d: "I know, or they have this image and then these words and then you spend your time going, 'how is that supposed to relate to this picture, and is there some other information I should be accessing?'"

P , i: "[wearing headphones is the] kind of a habit really she's [autistic daughter] just got herself into. I think she likes to take out extraneous noise."

P , g: "It's these sensory things [sensitivity to extraneous noise] that neurotypicals don't get - well, some do on some occasions but it's very hard to grasp"

A, P, d: "…the floor being slightly unbalanced, like the floor in my supermarket…I'm known to stagger, as if I'm slightly drunk, or if the floor's a little bit uneven, because I have vestibular issues."

A , d: "…in hindsight I understand that that [sensory processing] was pretty much the cause of every issue that we had as a family, and I now understand that there are ways that I can deal with that in the future"

A , d: "…getting a free pair of beats headphones with my laptop has totally changed my life."

A, d: "My problem is – well I've got many, but is that I can be hugely variable from one day to the next"

A, d, i: "when I was growing up…I'd have meltdowns in public areas…and my parents often wouldn't know what to do as well."

A, d: "I worked in an office where there was a prayer room, and I kept having panic attacks a lot, and someone said to me … 'oh you can go to the prayer room', and it was a bit awkward because obviously it was mostly for people who need to go and pray 5 times a day, but it was useful to know that if I just thought… I feel that I'm getting het up to the extent that I'm going to do something or say something that I don't want to at work, I can just go to this place"

A, d: "…if every train station had a…a quiet room: not where someone can go and have a business conversation on their phone, but…an actual quiet room where you can appreciate if you're in it that some people might be trying to quieten down, rather than you have to be quiet like in a library, it's just a quiet space where people understand that the world can be a difficult place and we have a space, so that you're not on a platform or a concourse"

A, d: "I did have lots of noise sensitivities, not just in social situations, but I didn't like the fireworks going off around me, I used to really, really, really dread bonfire's night as well as new year's eve coming around every single year, because I knew that I would not only have to put fingers in my ears, but also even put some red headphones around me just to block out the noise – and some of the ways my parents would bear the brunt of it, I honestly thought like, 'oh, this bad thing', and the fear would also then catch up with me emotionally in order for me to have my train of thought of, you know, how to get over that particular fear. The way they would deal with it would be they would also write to the local MSP, member of the Scottish national parliament, to basically say, 'you know we need to ban these fireworks', just to deal with the sensitivity that I had. And then growing up I had, at the age of 13, when I was taken to my first fireworks display, I began to understand why people chose to celebrate with those items every year, if I can so loosely refer to it, and it's only because they have a particular reason to do so – and you validify what it really is. And I went to a particular fireworks display and when I could hear it going off, sure enough, my fear started to dramatically go away, albeit it just went away slightly."
Non-autistic responses to autistic people and autism

A , d: "…since I'm 'high-functioning' myself, my parents do tell me their stories about how they had to deal with me growing up, because I had lots of hearing sensitivities and I had lots of social problems."

A , d: "…just for context, I was ridiculed from the moment I first set foot in school because I behaved in a 'not normal' way, and I was dubbed bad, and none of it was ever in my control. But I wasn't diagnosed with autism until I left school."

A , d: "I think that growing up thinking that I was constantly naughty meant that I was depressed by the age of 7"

A , d: "I feel like I minutely interrogate everything I think and feel, because I've been made to feel strange for my whole life"

A , d: "…lots of neurotypical people…if someone was being terrible in an office, and maybe it really upset me, and I would go and speak to someone and they'd be like, 'oh, they've just been dumped by their girlfriend', it blew my mind – just sort of like, 'how could they let that affect how they interact with me as if I've done something terrible?'"

P, A, d: "I'm a human library book and when I'm being read as an autistic person, [people] say, 'Are you here to talk about autism?'. I say, 'no, I'm talking about me as an autistic person, and my experience of the world', and so they have to correct how they introduce me."

P, A, d: "Neurotypical people often make me think, 'well how on earth am I supposed to follow that.'"

P , i: "My wife always suspected [autistic daughter] had a bit [of autism]: she had a bit of experience I never had."

P , g: 'like most people I…knew nothing about it [autism]"

P , g: "he [autistic son] is 19 now, so it's been most of his life…it's been around all the time for us."

P , g: "[Autism was] certainly not something I knew about, not something anybody knew anything about"

P , d: "…it's been a total learning curve. I've been learning everything, finding out everything, finding every stage -"

P , g: "…when you're ignorant, you're ignorant… we're not malignantly ignorant, unfortunately we just are…"

P , i: "…she'll [autistic daughter] tell you about a lot of what she experienced at school…out and out prejudice really"

P , d: "…we do have these [strains to do with normativity] quite a lot…particularly when there's been a meltdown that one could predict…then you get a row afterwards"

P , i: [About an autistic woman] "…she's gone off to uni – she didn't last long in uni because other issues cropped up, like everything that's happened this year, combined with her ASD that messed it up for her."

P , i: "…I'm the parent of somebody's who's high-functioning, so that comes with its own pros and con"

R, T, g: " …this is quite a common dynamic whether someone's autistic or not, right, so there's a kind of a natural period of rebellion maybe…"

R, T, d :' my attitude to my parent's view of me has changed over time a lot, like my assessment of whether they do actually know what's best for me, and I think that's a kind of journey that many people are on"

R, T, i: "I think autism complicates it [the dynamic with parents] because I think it's been so misunderstood by society, and science before"

P , d: "it's been constant battles we never wanted to fight and never thought we would, but we've had to."

P , d: "Without going into the battles I'm glad you said that"

P , i "If you've got ASD you're a target for being bullied, I think we all know that, but one of my other daughters who was at the same school, she was being bullied on behalf of her sister who was being bullied."

P , i "…we sent them to different schools just for that reason [because of bullying], because we have a different second name as well, so it's not even like "Smith" where you could be like, well he's not – people know straight away. But we chose different schools so he could be [name] and not just [A]'s brother. So that he could be an individual and start without the teachers knowing about him being [A]'s brother, and he could start with individuality, so yeah, it's a challenge".

P, g: "I know people have been learning a lot about these non-aggressive or passive response methods… but it requires a very conscious effort for somebody to acquire those skills, because the whole thing is counterintuitive." A, d: "…stop telling me to get out of bed and ask me, 'would you like to get out of bed?" P, i: "…whether that's [not wanting to get out of bed] an ASD thing or not I don't know"

P, d: "I've got nothing better than my daughter to live for, so it's just as well I love all of her…I understand that autism, and all her co-occurring conditions, are an intrinsic part of who she is".

A , d: "…the issue I've always had is that because of my conditions that they weren't fully understood, I was ridiculed when I entered school as a 'bad child'…my entire life the only people who haven't seen me as bad are my parents"

A , d: "…we've got hundreds and hundreds of letters hidden around the house of me apologising every time I got in trouble, because I was so ashamed that I was being bad"

A , d: "I also talked in our group…about the effects on siblings as well…and it does go everywhere…and it doesn't just affect the person…it affects everybody around them, especially if something's not going in the way that society would want."

P, i: [Autistic daughter] frequently will say to us in a moment of frustration, "as parents you say you love me, but you don't love that [autistic] part of me," and my response is usually something like, "it's hard to do that in the moment", and this kind of thing, that autism is a building block within a person who has a condition and that it is invariably felt by people in a family as a negative thing, I mean it is not nice for a person with ASD to experience that."

P , g/i: "people don't want meltdowns, but they happen, and unfortunately a neurotypical way of dealing with it is – well, you could say it is negative, but it is a gut reaction, and even with all of the awareness and training that I've collected over the years…it's very difficult."

A , i: "…my parents ended up having to learn it [guidance on dealing with meltdowns] from the units I attended…particularly in primary school, that look this is the ways that you've got to [speak] to your child"

A, d: "you [parents] have got to say to…your [autistic] son or daughter, 'right, this is what we've got to do today', and it's got some example, like, "a moment from now – we're gonna do this this or that, and it's gonna be the next thing."

A, i: "…I think a lot of the things that non-autistic people think autistic people do is rude, is because they're [non-autistic people] trained not to…say the truth."

A, d: "…at the same time we need to try and say about society, if they want to learn about disability rights and the way we need to cope with things in society, we need to reach out to society in a way that says, 'we need you to understand our trains of thought', without then imposing any strains of political correctness on them at the same time."

A, g: "…there's been a trend going around, and I see it especially in places like England, whereby if anyone were to be told, 'okay you're going to learn about disability rights today', or even with the same issue like minority rights or environment issues, the standard response would be, 'oh gosh, we're gonna get talked to, we're gonna have our hearts and our minds changed all the time', and I think it's really important that we cannot go into that particular realm of suspicion, because I've been through the main teachings of how we get people to understand our concerns"

A, d: "I once had a problem that if someone at work wrote me an email that I thought was rude or whatever, I'd just respond like whatever, and then it would be a problem, because I'd said what I really thought – and what I learned was that you're not supposed to do that, you have to train yourself to be different."

A , i: "maybe they [parents] had to let off some steam about it because, well who knows what could happen if the parent was told, "well you're not allowed to say it"…they've [parents] therefore got to keep it within themselves"…if they [parents] keep having to hold it back and hold it back and hold it back…the main problem that might develop from it is that this builds up and builds up like a bubble until something really triggers them to go over the edge and they implode one day, and they may end up really going over the edge and doing something really bad even to other people around them, or to their child itself – so that's the main point I ended up wanting to raise about it."
Code of Conduct

A, P , d :"…this is where laws are very important because there's nothing that can help the world go around more than to have a clear set of rules to say, "actually, what you did was in breach of this"…and then to be collaborators with people who are trying to contribute to the site, instead of being gatekeepers.

A , d: "What…people tend to find in good taste and what they find in bad taste in general tends to be quite subjective"

A , d: "I … agree with all of the points that have been made around the subjective nature of a lot of these sorts of issues."

A , d: "…there are certain things that will be obvious in terms of their intention and in terms of their harm, that can be easily dealt with, but a lot of this is very subjective."

A , d: "I mean, honestly that's particularly an issue with autistic people, I've got to say that's me in many situations, you know – we think our views are facts, and it's hard to take in other's opinions – I'm not generalising though"

A , d: "…unfortunately there's a lot of things that we're being told nowadays that we can and cannot say, and of course the latter keeps expanding and expanding and expanding, which includes even the most harmless and pettiest of examples.:"

A , d: "How can we be sure that the things we do contribute to these sorts of platform…can actually be balanced enough to…say, 'we have enough to express ourselves?'"

A , d: "…if somebody was to say something that you or I wouldn't like, then it's best to deal with it in a public debate, in an open space, rather than just trying to censor that particular thing – so there needs to be a clear balance struck out."

A , d: "That makes me feel…super uncomfortable."

A , d: "…in terms of the language people use and knowing whether things might be offensive to people…my job is a journalist, and I'm an editor, and I've edited a lot of people's opinion articles, and one of the things that I've found most useful, especially when I'm dealing with people who aren't writers but are writing about their experience, is to try and make sure people remember to write from their perspective, and that they're saying what happened to them and what they think, and I'm trying not to make generalisations about people or groups of people, and that often helps people to say, 'this thing happened to me', and, 'here's how it was and here's how I felt', rather than, 'this group of people does this type of thing to people like me', which is…automatically much more confrontational even if it is essentially trying to tell the same story."

A , d: "…have a way to really emphasise to people not to make generalisations, and that they're…completely allowed to say what happened to them and what they think about something but making sure that they take ownership of the pieces that they're using, not kind of broad-brushing over whole groups of people, which is when you tend to get issues where it's sort of offensive."

P , d: "a code of conduct almost feels like a political or an academic kind of thing"

P , i: "One thing I question is, is code of conduct actually the right word or phrase to use… we've got this whole thing about high functioning, low functioning autism, or whatever, and some people are gonna get it, and some people won't, so obviously a lot of things like that need to be looked at.

R, T, d: "…having clear rules [is] the best way I can think of to resolve some of that ambiguity which results from different subjective views"

R, T, d: "Certainly, I'm finding it quite complex…all the different balancing acts with all the different points of view."

R, T, d: "…my feeling is, having to actually concretely design this in some way…probably there's no prefect solution for everyone, but... a reasonable balance."

P , g: [Emphasis on treating everyone as an individual] "…everybody who's involved with people on the spectrum – we all know that the answer is to learn, and it's not easy, it's to learn how to treat each person as an individual, that's all we really need to do as human beings, and that would sort out all the problems in the world, wouldn't it? But we're talking about something much smaller…I'm just wondering if that could maybe come in as a sort of, as an umbrella thought for this thing?"

R, T, d "I think that's a really great suggestion"

R, T, d "I think the AutAngels one [code of conduct] that I was using as a basis really emphasises that everyone is different, and that's a positive thing about this community"

R, T, d "…if you can take time to appreciate different people, and the different ways of being in the world and ways they like to express themselves, then that's useful."

P , g: "It's easy to say this, isn't it"

R, T, d "Yeah, and hard to do – "

P , g: "…everyone has to deal with Donald Trump for 4 years, and…he's started this thing…He'll say to journalists, "I don't like you and I don't believe a word you say", and obviously that has coloured a lot of opinions in many different areas – but…that's hopefully on the way out now…

R, T, d "Yeah, I think it does take a lot more attention and effort than maybe it seems at first to carve out a space where that doesn't happen"

A, g: "you're never going to find the perfect middle ground, but you have to get as close as you possibly can and then try to review that as time goes on."

A, P , d: "I think it's important about the advisory thing, about how to go about putting in posts, so for instance if the bit about reporting on behalf of other people was done by one or two of the moderators and co-produced or something, that might be better than it being written by the researcher describing, 'well that's what you've got to do', so you know it's somebody autistic, or you know has a knowledge of how easy it is to just vent…and then they say, 'try not to', it would…carry more weight."

R, T, d: "I think is really interesting, if we're writing a code of conduct, how do we make sure that it's not – basically just discriminating against autistic people by being a kind of non-autistic view of what's appropriate?"

A , d: "Good question"

R, T, i: "…a lot of people in previous discussion brought up that their sense of what was rude was different to what non-autistic people might judge as being rude"

R, T, i: "…they were constantly thinking, 'I have to change my behaviour to make someone who's not autistic feel comfortable, and they're never changing their behaviour to make me feel comfortable'

A, d: "[if] somebody says something that you disagree with you can disagree with them in a civil way."

P , d: "a code of conduct almost feels like a political or an academic kind of thing"

A, d: "I think that some of the values are really clear at the outset, that it isn't a place to vent…it is supposed to be truthful, but you should be thinking about what you're saying before you say it."

R, T, i: "…having autistic people write it was what I thought would be the most helpful thing."
Feedback on existing code of conduct

A , d: "…because I have epilepsy, I'm a strong advocate for co-morbidity and I think it is brilliant that you are mentioning it straight out, because I find that on the other side neurology doesn't necessarily consider autism as much"

A, d : "I'm not sure if autism is considered to be a neurological condition, but it is often tied to neurological conditions"

A, P , d: "…I think we just said with the behaviours part that you have to put 'placeism'."

A, d : "I mentioned to you briefly about the word 'neurology', and I was just wondering if you or any other...moderators on here would be able to clarify specifically what they meant by that?"

A , d: "I think just working out specifically what is meant by that term ['neurology'] and working out a more direct way of explaining that [would help].

A , d: "…my first question as someone with a co-morbid neurological condition is that, in the list of self-identifying factors, what is specifically meant by neurology?"

A , d: "I really do love that neurological differences is emphasised as from the other side of it, autism is often totally ignored in the neurology world, so yeah, to me that was interesting, but unspecific."

P, A , d: "…when I read that paragraph with the four social rules, I found it really, I think, condescending in a way – "

P, A , d: "Yeah, I didn't like those [the four social rules] at all"

P, A , d: "…I saw 'no feigning surprise', and I thought, "Huh! I'm an autistic person, I have to act all the time about being surprised, or being happy."

P, A , d: "[It] does feel a bit, I don't know, condescending to have this, 'no feigning surprise' when actually autistic people have to mask in order to fit in"

P, A , d: "It [the 'no feigning surprise rule] wasn't mentioned that way, and it was about being condescending to others."

P, A , d: "I'm not an alien in all my social conversations, so I don't automatically go through all these variations, so to see it written out like that, I thought, 'why do we have to do that', and I just found that personally confusing…the idea that there's social principles"

P, A , d: "I struggle with the fact that…autism is a social communication disorder, so…using words like 'social principles' makes me feel like you have to pass through…some kind of judgement barrier in order to do stuff."

P, A , d: "Yeah, I think that, because I think especially when you go into the four social rules there's a whole block of writing about, it's almost like, 'Oh, because you've got social communication difficulties, we're going to tell you how to be polite, and I think that could be worded in a more constructive-criticism way."

P, A , d: "These [the four social rules] are like good illustrations, asking autistic people for things."

P, A , d: "[It's] just the tone – I mean, I'm quite aware I need a nudge now and then…it's always helpful to remind me now and then not to speak over people too much. But I think there's a less condescending way of doing that"

P, A , d: "I'm not sure [about] the 5th bullet of expected behaviour… this [platform] isn't just for non-autistic people, this is for everyone…it just seems weird the way it's drafted it's just a bit limited. I think it needs to be broader in scope."

P, A , d: "Yeah, so I guess the way I took that [the 5th bullet of expected behaviour] is kind of, when you're talking about your experiences, don't be like, 'this autistic person in the cinema kept talking and rocking, and it was really distracting'."

P, A , d: "…if this [code of conduct] is focussed foremost on autistic people sharing their experiences, then this [the 5th bullet point] is a bit of a funny bullet."

P, A , d: "I think we …need to…word it [the 5th bullet point] differently"

P, A , d: [Reword the 5th bullet point], "to be more inclusive"

P, A , d: "…the first bullet in 2.2… has got that language, 'if they don't feel positive about their autism"

P , d: "…the language being used, so wondering if you actually discussed that in your groups?"

A, P , d: "…in our breakout room we raised points on the language generally as well, things like, it's all well and good people on the autistic spectrum having social difficulties, but it did feel quite condescending when you went and launched into, "don't feign surprise"

A, d: "I didn't even know what feigned means, for one"

A, P, d: "…before I went into what you [researchers] were trying to say, and the thought behind it, I thought, "well, you spend your life putting on an act that's socially appropriate, and now you're trying to tell us not to feign being surprised: but maybe we're actually supposed to be surprised and then we have to go and do it", so I've fed that back, and some of the language I thought was a little bit condescending in my view."

R, T, d: "…there's quite a lot of things that are quite easy fixes R, T, d: "we can fix… the phrasing of the guidelines for the platform" R, T, d: "…we can use a standard sort of voice" R, T, d: "…I hadn't read that blog post about the social norms in a long time…I haven't read it in probably two years, and now that you say, it's absolutely full of idioms…and that is unnecessarily complicated for the points that we want to make, so…that's the key thing."
Tone

A , d: "I've had this issue with my editorial board at [organisation], because we're trying to make a blog site that is fully accessible to everybody, in aged 16-25, that doesn't sound patronising, and it is going to be very difficult to find that middle ground" A , d: "…a tone of voice, as well as a code of conduct, is essential for any of these kind of platforms" R, T, d: "I just wanted to circle back to: [A], you made a point about a tone of voice – so there's a code of conduct and then there's a tone of voice for the platform – and I'm curious to have us sort of dig into that a little bit more, because I think I don't totally understand what you mean by tone of voice for the platform." A, d: "I mean, this is not a platform that you're going to be posting on, it's different when it's a platform that the organisation is posting on." A , d: "…coming up with a set of rules for yourself, I mean a set of rules how it would be worded on the site, and a set off rules if somebody would get a response from a moderator, to say this is inappropriate, just making sure there is a continual, there is a consistency across all the language that is used on the platform itself, and making sure that that is the right way of saying things" A : "so it's not too strict but it's not too simple; it's not too complicated to understand but it's not too patronising…finding that middle ground and making sure everything written on the site follows that same pattern, essentially"

P , d: "…it does make sense, yeah, I mean all these things are true so to speak"
Metaphorical/non-literal language

A, P , d: "…to me there was some language in there [about the four social rules] that wasn't necessarily understandable to a lot of autistic people, including a lot of idioms, indeed there were two in one explanation. The section is literally called "back street driving", and then the second section uses the phrase "too many cooks", and…if you're using that kind of language to explain something to autistic people it's probably it's not going to work so well."

A, P , d: "I think most people know: do most people not know about that [the use of idioms]? It's just like learning another piece of a language, that we've done in our lifetimes?"

A, d: "I know friends of mine only take everything literally. There are certain idioms that, although I knew what they meant, I found them bizarre growing up; like the idea of flying colours - colours don't fly"

A, P , d: "…fair point, we should demonstrate that we are autistic-aware by not throwing in those things [idioms].'
Negative language

A, g: "…it literally could just be that the person does not know how to articulate what they were going to say, and it ends up inappropriate, and that just would be discriminatory to remove that post just because they're struggling"

A , d: "using…swearwords, however petty, like 'bloody meltdown' or whatever, it's not helpful to the research"

A, d: "I'll admit I probably swear more, I do swear more, than I…sometimes I don't even know that I'm doing it, so I can accidentally say a word and not know"

A , g: "…in society there is not such a massive understanding of why someone – a child or an adult - would have a meltdown – and using language that makes it seem like an unreasonable and bad thing that they've done is really unhelpful, when actually we know that the world has not been designed for autistic people"

P, A , d: "I think that you can say that non-autistic people must try not to complain or criticise autistic people"

P, A , d: "We're going to keep facilitating stigma if that's the way we're going to treat [autism]: 'this autism, this bit of my autism means this for me', no, 'this is who I am', so I think we need to have (R) fostering the right language as well…it's autistic people's experiences, not people's experiences of their autism."

A, R, A, i: "I imagine with (R) it was probably just a bad phrasing, she's normally very sensitive to that…"

R, T, d: "…one way to do that [deal with swearwords in posts] would be to have very explicitly somewhere in the code of conduct: "you can express yourself with swearwords in a frustrated way, in an angry way, if that is your experience"

P , d: "I use that word, that mild swearing deliberately because I think it does emphasise a point, and we don't want to censor, and we don't want to frustrate people who think this could be a much-needed opening"

P , d: "I'm wondering if this could be an age thing, this thing about using passionate language"

P , i: "Young people [use language differently] with even the abbreviations they're using texting or WhatsApping all the time, like the initials WTF, for example"

P , d: "…when I first got an email from somebody with "WTF…I messaged back and said, this is a business thing…this is not appropriate", but then that's because I'm…a 60-year-old person, this would have been somebody a lot younger.

P , g: "…whether or not you have ASD, there are some people who will be offended for one reason or another, and others wouldn't be"

A , d: "…when someone ended up using that term [bloody], when we saw the comments there, I controversially did not think it was therefore exclusive of autistic people as an entire collective, but really it was an opinion-share from them, as individuals, in…the individual case of dealing with their child"

A , d: "...the main issue was we were talking about what language they can and can't use in these sorts of forums."

A , d: "…it was brought up earlier in the conversation that the word, 'bloody', was used by one of the parents, and they say – 'oh it's ruined my day.'…in a way it does help to understand their view of the situation."

A, i: "…maybe if people feel they can't express themselves because they can't use that kind of word, for example, then that might mean that we might just lose a whole chunk of people, and they might be the people who don't have the opportunities for education – I don't know, I might be making totally massive assumptions."
Emotions

A , d: "It [the code of conduct] does say that we have the right to express our anger and frustration about things, but I feel that there are probably things that would come up, that we would try to express our anger and frustrations about that would probably personally be no doubt flagged up, and therefore probably removed in the process. So how can we be sure of that?"

A , d: "if you're saying, 'Oh I'm the non-autistic person who's meant to be able to regulate my emotions', …you can regulate not using swearwords to describe in public your experiences of your child."

A , d: "I imagine it would be helpful for the researchers, the scientists, to see the emotion"

A , d: "…people have just no idea how rude they are by their emotions, they don't interrogate what they think and do, and that's a real problem with something like this, is people think their subjective view is objective fact."

A , i: "…now the way I see it is…a lot of people, especially neurotypical people, are so emotional all the time and have no comprehension that their emotions are driving them"

A , g: "… in a practical sense it's going to be quite difficult to police that: loads of people are accidentally going to let loads of their emotions about something go in [to their story]"

P, A , d: "You can actually post and be fairly neutral"

P , g: "…it's not about how we would be able to report it and reuse it [an experience of a parent's emotion], and the advice wouldn't be able to be used without the advice of the parent, which wouldn't help the forum or the feedback, so that might be a way to post without the emotion and the emotive side of it."

R, T, g: "…the guidance to go in the code of conduct would be, 'don't add your own emotion to this platform?'"

R, T, d: "…I think they [parents of autistic people] can say,' this is how this person was in this environment', but not how it made me [the parent] feel when they [the autistic person] reacted like that."

P, d: "I think that's something that has to be the facts [about the experience being shared by a non-autistic person], instead of emotion in it…when it's somebody else [other than the autistic person] who's writing it."

A, P , d: "…it's also going to be positioned as a means to share statement of facts: 'this happened to me, and I don't understand why', or a carer or parent saying, 'this was a situation that happened to a person I was caring for, and I don't understand why'.

A, d: "…I'm a journalist, I work with words every day, and I think there is such a difference between someone who's twisted themselves into a knot of fury about what's going on, and is just generalising and lashing out and all of this, and someone who's just used what they think is an obvious, truthful description of something but they didn't have vitriol behind it."

A , d: "I appreciate this is a very tricky thing, but like I've edited a lot of people's first-person opinion pieces, and what I always try to edit out is those words where you might be like, fuming and sticky sweaty hands because you so want to violently tell everyone what you think, and the people who are just trying to describe it and have accidentally slipped in to a thing where it's like, 'that isn't how we refer to those people by the way'."

A, d: "…what someone said to me is, 'if it feels really good in a mean way to write, you probably shouldn't include it', and I think that's a really good test case here, like if you went to read it out in front of people who want to give you a job, would you say it?"

A, d: "…autistic people might say things that other people might think are rude, but I think it's not a different world – whereas this thing where you're trying to inflict harm with your words compared to when you're just trying to express yourself, I think that's different."

A, d: "I wonder if it would be good to maybe be really obvious…maybe if you're really angry about something, offer us a solution, like 'what would have made it better?'"

P, g: "…what we discussed was how to report without the emotion in it – so you're actually reporting about something"

P , d: "I think the emotion would be really the problem for me, because I think situations can be emotive, but I think that's outside of the how that thing happened and how that made you feel has no effect on what it was that happened and the sensory issues at the time, that was your emotion about the situation, so for research purposes, I think that needs to be stipulated from the start, that that shouldn't be in it – how it made the parent or the person reporting it feel."

A, d, g: "…at one point when I was younger, I used to think, 'yes, getting people to be borderline forced into it would be one way', but I learned at the same time, you can't police people's emotions and thereby how they react to things."
Speaking on behalf of others/supporting others to speak

A, P , d: "[on] that point about speaking for others, and when parents or carers do that…I think it needs to be very clear, that's your experience of a person who had potentially a sensory thing going on, and not to put any assumptions onto that person" A, P , d: "…the example you gave in one of your quotes, if an autistic person said their parents may have said they had a meltdown and the autistic person goes, 'they may have had an issue with the flickering lights", go to the autistic person and go, "how do you know it was the flickering lights?": it could be build up from the last three days, that the last final straw was a vestibular issue dealing with a wonky floor, not the visual image of the light"

A, d: "…to change it back to this separation, when I was thinking about…conflicts…between parents using the site, and…actual autistic people, I was thinking…which side would be more concerned about something they wrote being seen by the other" A, d: "I think I probably say most of what I feel to my parents, but I doubt they say it all to me" A, i "…it's whether the parents would feel more upset about whether their children are reading something they'd written, or if the children would be upset if they saw something they'd written…so that is I think why it does seem sort of essential to have two segregations"

A, P , d: "…I've seen on social media, parents have a lot more issue about when autistic people write about their experiences as children, they usually have a whole host of issues…and they then try to silence all those who can't speak." A, P , d: "…my concern about hearing all that is that for those who have co-occurring conditions, and find life really tough, and learning disabilities and all the rest, it can't be much of those kids they [parents] can love then, is there, if they don't love the autistic part of them too." A, P, g: "…the autistic person might not know unless they have pointed to the lights and articulated it, so I think it's an important point to make it clear that that's your interpretation and it could be this or that, and if that's your input then it could be created, unless that individual was in some way communicated with, and that is not just an ability to speak issue is it, it's about understanding your own issues and being self-aware."

A , P , d "…I don't know how we're all responding so linearly because we're assuming the parents of other people who are non-verbal want their experiences to be entered in the same way as everybody is able - to use the "normal" inverted commas, thing."

A, P , d: "…one thing that was said in the presentation that – and we did discuss this in the group, that I didn't get from the bits we scanned earlier, was that it was 'autistic first', but 'welcoming and inclusive for others', and I'm thinking in reality how these sorts of things happen is the autistic people can sort of get drowned out by the volume of people who want to speak on their behalf"

A , d: "…in terms of the language people use and knowing whether things might be offensive to people…my job is a journalist, and I'm an editor, and I've edited a lot of people's opinion articles, and one of the things that I've found most useful, especially when I'm dealing with people who aren't writers but are writing about their experience, is to try and make sure people remember to write from their perspective, and that they're saying what happened to them and what they think, and I'm trying not to make generalisations about people or groups of people, and that often helps people to say, 'this thing happened to me', and, 'here's how it was and here's how I felt', rather than, 'this group of people does this type of thing to people like me', which is…automatically much more confrontational even if it is essentially trying to tell the same story."

A, d: "…have a way to really emphasise to people not to make generalisations, and that they're…completely allowed to say what happened to them and what they think about something but making sure that they take ownership of the pieces that they're using, not kind of broad-brushing over whole groups of people, which is when you tend to get issues where it's sort of offensive."

A , d "…what we should be working towards is making sure that those situations [which cause meltdowns] aren't stressful for lots of people… even non-autistic people, and to describe how they affected someone when it really upset them, in a way that blames them rather than is looking towards to a future in which that situation could have been better for them is…totally missing the point of the exercise, and…further dehumanising a difficult situation this person experiences"

R, T, d: "Thank you so much [A] I think that's really beautifully put and I'm really glad we've captured that."

R, T, d: "I think there's a distinction between – and actually, [A], I'm thinking about what you said this morning – there's a distinction between saying, 'I am frustrated at myself; I had a meltdown and I was annoyed about it – it was difficult for me'. There's a difference to saying, 'this is how I felt, and I am sharing my experience', vs. somebody else sharing the experience."

A , d: "for me and how I understand scientific research… if that's for research it should be really clear that that's people's perspective, and whatever the difficulties of the research are, that means that you didn't manage to access the real source material."

A , d: '…so long as it is flagged that the person who wrote this is not the person that they say they're speaking for, then it ought to be possible to have research that understands that

limitation."

A , d: "…in some cases there will have to be a degree of facilitation to allow that to happen [someone who is non-verbal or having non-verbal needs using the platform], for a parent or carer, whether that's just to arrange a time and place to do that, or to make sure the correct functionality is in place."

A , d: "Parents, in my opinion, should be allowed to actually say even their deepest frustrations about how they seem to be dealing with things, particularly about how their children have meltdowns and things, because I've had that happen to me before, in certain situations in public...but to try and therefore claim that somehow if they start using certain pejorative language like, "bloody", and all this, somehow excludes autistic people including myself, somehow I find that to be…false actually, because if it was really inclusionary they would be making it really clear about what they actually think of us…"

A , d: "I don't think it's a matter of being exclusionary as a whole"

A , d: "…there's this slightly separate issue – I don't know if people agree with that or not, but it's around… parents and guardians uploading their experiences onto the platform, and how that's done in a sensitive way – it seems to need more discussion at the moment."

A , d: 'And on that second point I think that's a really tricky question, because obviously you want the platform to…be as truthful and accurate as possible for research purposes, but I would totally reiterate the point about it not being a place to – certainly not encouraging -venting, and I think it's a very, very tricky question about how you do that and how you balance those needs. I don't have any answers to be honest, but I totally get all the points that have been raised."

A , d: "…thinking about it from that perspective [informing researchers], the idea of my parent potentially writing something about me potentially becomes less disturbing for me."

A , d: "…unless we're specifically wanting to collect information…also directly from parents directly about their experiences, you know that example about [A] was perfect, because the first one was, 'this upset [A] because [A] got upset and that happened before and [A] doesn't like that', in comparison to, 'this happened which made me feel this which made me do that'."

P, A , d: [autistic parents of autistic people and support workers posting] "That's the vehicle for positive inclusion"

P, A , d "…only when we got him [autistic son] mind-mapping and putting his own things forward, right in the middle of everything, did things start to work, and I still want to explore that, so if we just say that share stories, we're doing it in the exact same way, it's just another person sharing on behalf of someone else…I don't know…"

P, A , d "No, I don't think we should [share on behalf of someone else]."

P, A , d "I think we have to be clear that this is either the views of the individual that's been helped to communicate that, or it's not."

P, A , d "…my concern is that we are as a society so far away from doing this meaningfully, or knowing how to do this meaningly – "

P, A , i: "I would say that my son's PA – if my son has a problem communicating, that his PA could sum up things better than I possibly could…even though I probably spend more time on the planet with my son. But my PA's not emotionally invested, and sees things clearer when he sees him not doing something, not being able to say what he thinks."

P, A , g: "…there are different tiers even within support workers, so we're saying parents, but that's probably also supposed to be support workers or people working with autistic people, and so the definition between being a parent and a support worker, that also needs to be defined."

P, A , d "…you would have to have a different sort of moderation and a different sort of help for that moderation [moderating reporting about others]."

P, A , i: "I can see me reading him [my son] something"

P, A , d: "I don't think I can see me ever doing it [share an experience] on his [my son's] behalf"

P, A , i "…so far everything has been virtual but he's [my son is] already so hyped up and anxious about actually entering [something into the platform], and I feel that on the day that he actually does there'll be this huge knock-on effect that he'll want to talk about"

P, A , i: "I think he [my son] might feel better if it does go towards some research, but he may be so upset about it that he can't do it totally by himself, so I'd work alongside him, but I don't think I could do it for him because he's at that stage now after a lot of mentoring and help that he'd just want to shoot me and attack me for doing it wrong."

P, A , d: "There needs to be clear guidelines"

P, A, d, g: "…too often, the way the world is, if somebody has a great difficulty communicating then their parents might jump in and communicate for them, and their support worker will communicate for them, rather than… facilitating, taking resource into hearing what they have actually got to say, and exploring their feelings about things"

P, A, d, g: "The real version" [what the person with difficulty communicating has actually got to say]

P, A, d, i: "I'm lucky my son can kind of do postings himself now… he was nervous about posting"

P, A , d, i: "Other people, they're not so used to it [posting online], so they'd rely on us as autistic parents or support workers to put things in for them"

P, A , d: "I think some of the discussion is not that targeted"

P, A, d: "Yes, we need parents' and carers' perspectives, because that's to do with their experience of what's happening, because they are the ones who may need to provide support, but there's guidelines on how that needs to be done"

P, A, d: "…there's a different discussion when you're looking at someone inputting on behalf of the views of someone else, or from their experience – so there's two things here that we're getting a bit conflated."

P, A, d: "…my short experience of doing that bit [communicating] on the part of my son, I was never satisfied with what I read back or what I saw happen. I just knew that we hadn't got it right…"

P, A, d: "…it's not okay for parents to say, 'oh my child had a meltdown, and it was tricky for me in the supermarket', but they can say the flickering lights bothered them. Well, I will say - actually, unless they've told you it's a flickering light, or communicated that, you can't assume it's the flickering lights"

P, A, d: "…the second part of the bitly thing [the platform wireframe] says, 'what would have made things better?' Well, if the parents say what they'd do better…that is trying to climb into one's head that you can't possibly do, because you don't know what could have made it better [for them]."

P, A, d: "…you don't know it's the flickering lights even – it's too many assumptions always made, and this is the issue…it becomes more harmful to put words and make assumptions like this, even if it's from the inside-out view – but it's not the inside-out view is it? It's what the other person's view is, and what their idea is – it could simply be unaddressed medical pain, right, it could simply be the vestibular issues of swirling that may be caused by noise…"

A, R, A, d: "…it sounds having that boundary between what the autistic people put forward, and what parents are…assuming on behalf of their child – how would you moderate that boundary, because it seems to be quite a blurred line?"

P, A , g: "…it may be that the parent believes they know their child better than anyone else, but that doesn't mean they know their child, or they know why this has happened…they're still making assumptions…they may know them more because they live with them, but they may not understand the issue."

P, A , d: "It may [the parent's report of an autistic person's experience] be more likely to be correct than coming from anyone else, but it may still not be the right thing."

P, A , d: "I think you have to be clear – if you are assuming, based on your best understanding, that this is the case, then please express this in your writing."

R, T, i: "It's so interesting, the different perspectives on this one [sharing on behalf of others], because there were some people [in focus groups] who were saying, basically, 'I would be happy about parents talking about their own experience, but not talking about an autistic person's experience, because then they're talking over someone else', whereas I think what you're saying is that you would be happy them supporting someone else to talk about their experience."

P , d: Yes, as long as they're aware of that's what's happening [someone else is supporting them to enter the autistic person's experience]

P , d: "…it's got to be that person's voice [the autistic person], it can't come from somebody else's opinion, I think that's really important"

R, T, i: "…what I'm getting from this discussion is the importance of emphasising supporting someone else to express themselves, rather expressing something on their behalf",

P , g: "…not everyone has a supportive family and a network of how"

P , i: "[Autistic daughter] is a very good spokesperson on her own behalf"

R, T, i: "There is a group of parents of those who can't really express themselves so easily, who would want to say maybe about their child's experience rather than about their own"

R, T, i: "some autistic people feel quite…I guess skeptical about parents' ability to speak about autistic people's experiences"

R, T, i: "A lot of parents feel quite passionately that they do have something valuable to say"

R, T, i "…a lot of autistic people as well say that they [parents] have a lot of value to bring"

R, T, d: What guidelines would you put for someone sharing an experience on behalf of someone else?"

P, g :"We're aware and we can be sympathetic, but a sad, hard fact is we're not in the mind of our own child"

P , d: "The only thing I would feel really uncomfortable with would be parents telling something on behalf of their children or telling their story"

P , i: "I know my [autistic] son would hate [me telling his story] because that's [his] story, so I don't it's my place to be able to comment."

P , i: "I think if he [autistic son] saw things like that [people talking about the experiences of autistic people on their behalf], that would probably make him not want to use that [the platform"

P , i "Having said that, that comment about the positive and the negative that, "[A] had a blooming meltdown again" was a really good point, and hands up I've never managed to be consistently positive about the situation."

R, T, d: "What do you both think about issues of inferring what might be going on for somebody who's autistic, internally?"

P , g: "…a lot of people do have fantastic relationships with their autistic family, and they are the people who live with them every day and see their reactions, but…it is their presumption or assumption of that situation, but if they see it over and over and over again, they can say, 'in this situation numerous times this has happened'.

P , d: "…It's about the wording isn't it, it's about how you word that, not saying 'I know what they were thinking', but saying, 'in this situation they acted like this'. I know that's hard."

P , i: "…sharing to some young people… can be horrendous with their families, it could be something they don't want them to know of, and having to have their families to maybe do it for them might be another reason why they might not access it, while if they had someone who was maybe going to be able to do it for them, they may use that instead."

P , i: "…we all think of our families as partners but I'm also aware there's a lot of young people who do not have support at all and don't have that family network, who still need support externally, because that's where they're able to get it."

R, T, i: "…relying on families to be benign isn't always the case actually"

P , i: "…I'm in a youth charity at the moment, so I see a lot of young people where it's just not accepted to be anything apart from what they think of as normal. So young people couldn't go to peer groups or parents. It just wouldn't be seen at all to be accepted, and it's hard and they just will not tell people at all, so they just need to have another outlet somewhere."

R, T, i: "…I could see that if you spend your life living with, supporting, caring for, or there's someone autistic that you care about thet you've spent a lot of your life with, then that's going to give you a perspective that's a lot more than an average person…it's going to be different to their own perspective but it seems still valuable"

P , i: "…I thought it was really interesting the slide where the parent can post the experience of the person, so nothing personal for them, so that sort of changed my mind a bit, because obviously my son is verbal and very able to explain himself, but if he wasn't I think that would maybe be one of the guidelines that parents are able to post, but it would be literally about an experience, not… how they felt about the experience at all, and they would still be able to input into it without their personal experience of the situation – maybe saying, 'we went here and this caused this' without any feeling, and that may be something that would need to be moderated, which would get that side across, but without the personal side…"

R, T, i: "…being able to recognise or think about your experience and express it in some form, in some situations it seems that the easiest route to that would be to have a parent support their child to do it, or even just upload a video or something like that, not inferring anything or making some kind of judgement – they're just showing something."

P , i: "…that feeling of…a young person who's maybe struggling still having to rely on a parent, they still might not want a parent to see their artwork, or whatever they've made."

P , i: "It might [the experience an autistic person wants to share] be something they just really don't want their parents to know about."

P , i: "…[have] a more advanced user [of the platform] who is able to upload or do that for them [enter an experience on behalf of an autistic person]."

P , d: "If someone's non-verbal, or whoever is posting an experience on behalf of them it's more the situation, not [how] they interpret it, so 'this is what happened', and, 'this is how they felt', so even if it's just the facts of what happened in that event, instead of them trying to interpret that, I think that's maybe something that is stuck in it from the start."

P , d: "I don't think that's [alongside autistic people's experiences on the platform] the right place [for parents to get support], because I do think they need to be separate for me."

P , i: "I think sadly that [having parents' experiences alongside autistic people's experiences] would put young people off wanting to be involved, especially if they don't have good relationships with their parents, or they feel judged.

P , i: "They [autistic people] might feel that they're going to be judged in that environment [in which parents share experiences], so it might stop people using it."

P , d: 'I know my story …I don't think this [platform] is the right place for that"

P , d: "I think seeing things posted [about autistic people by others] … I don't think they would work together the two of them, I think there's a separate place for it."

P , g: Parents of autistic people wanting to comment about the autistic person's experience shouldn't be allowed to use the platform, "unless it was a totally different part of the platform, unless it was separate, because it is a completely different thing: it's their representation of the young person, it's not that person's identity".

P , d: "for me I don't think [parents' comments about experiences] should be in the same places where my [autistic] son could go and say those things, because that's him saying it, and his feelings, whereas that is their representation of someone's feelings"

P , d: "There is a place for it [parents to share about their autistic children's experiences], but I don't think it would be there [the same place as autistic people sharing experiences]"

P , i: Sometime…the kids are brought along [to the parent group] and they play somewhere on the side, and I've seen the reaction of some of them with different levels of autism, how they react to their parents being involved…there's one young girl, I could see her when her dad was talking at the meeting rolling her eyes and so on…it's a difficult thing because we want to help our kids but we don't want to tread on their toes either."

P , d: "…if they [autistic users] were in some kind of education setting, you would also maybe have other people who may post on behalf of them so then that opens up another side, if they've asked somebody maybe to help them post something, to get that side of it as well, it might not just be a parent who posts for people…"

P , d: "…if educators could be invited onto this as well…"

P , d: "I don't know how…confidentiality… would work [if educators were brought on board]"

P , i: "…a lot of people in education are…so overwhelmed with everything"

P , d: "…the more resources there are available to them [people in education] [the better], and maybe someone can see what an autistic child feels and how they react, and why, and if they're basically getting information from the horse's mouth, albeit via a platform like this, that can only be a good thing."

P , d: "I do think that…whoever reports it, it needs to be the autistic person's story and not their [the reporter's] experience of the event, and that's the thing I think has got to come out of it the most."

P , i: "…even if it was only one forum and autistic people saw it, they would still see that it was factual and it wasn't really saying that, "I felt this" or, "oh it was a nightmare", and that will build up trust – so I think that would really be beneficial."

P , d: "It wouldn't always have to be a parent, it could be anybody who works really closely with them [the autistic person] and wants to tell that.

R, T, i: "…in those circumstances [someone helping an autistic person share] there's issues of consent, like can that person consent?

R, T, d: "…there's issues around, is it [sharing on behalf of others] an appropriate thing to do?"

P , d: "It's that confidentiality [that is an issue with parents sharing for autistic people]"

R, T, d: "What permission would you want to give to someone like that [the parent of a non-verbal autistic person]– do you think they should be able to use the platform?"

P , i: "We know young people want independence and need independence from their parents"

P , d: "We need to somehow encourage it [independence from parents]."

P , i: "I do still believe that people who can't express themselves, their near and dear ones still need the opportunity"

P , d: "I've been going to a parent's group with my wife for about 6 years now, and it got so big that it's probably just as well that we had lockdown because now they do it on Zoom rather than in their house"

R, T, d "…would you want to separate out the parents and the people with autism into different…groups"

P , d: "Yes, for me, yes"

P , d: "Yes, I would do at this stage, yes"

P , d: "- but…offer support to both"

R, T, i: "Right…absolutely"

P , g: 'I don't know exactly how this would work, but I know there's support around, we [group for parents of autistic people] haven't met since February, but I think 50 or 60 people go every week they go on the Zoom…because…the parents feel they need to discuss."

A, P, g: "…the people who are reporting on behalf of someone else, if there's no ability to edit after you put it in, are really thinking "you've done a shoddy job", and that's going to be awful"

A, d: "we were discussing around different sorts of users, and in relation to the presentation, we don't want it to be about neurotypical people talking about non-neurotypical people."

A, P, i: "There might be a point of misunderstanding though if a parent or a support worker, PA [personal assistant], or whatever, was reporting constantly, because they had this preconception that what had made things better was people who are writing for comments, that they think there are solutions that are going to be offered in the number of postings and they misunderstand how the data is being extracted, so something in the precursor of, you know, "why are you submitting the experiences and what's happened', but there will be people who go, "oh, oh, somebody's going to help me."

P , d: "…it's not always a parent who's reporting, and it might not be a supportive parent who's reporting, so it could be a really skewed report of something, so to get the facts it has to be a factual reporting, whether it's just a case of, 'we were in the train station this is what happened, and that's it', that will help, because it will tie into other people's findings"

P, d: "…some families are really not supportive, and [the experiences] they may put [into the platform] may be really counter-productive to the research and may not help at all, so I really think the emotion just really must not be in it."

R, T, g: "…we [the parent group] got to a place where we thought it might be a good idea to support someone else to be able to share a story, rather than to share a story on their behalf"

A , d: "…if there's going to be any level of somebody speaking on behalf of or even inputting on behalf of someone else, then that needs to be really clearly flagged that that's what's happened"

A, d: "…to be able to have a note that clued you into the limitations of an opinion that has been mediated in a way that can't be accounted for"

A, d: "– two elements of that – make it really clear who actually wrote the answers to that, and make it easy for people so it's not just mediated by other people."

A , d: "I just think people should be able to express themselves and if they want to express what they think someone else experiences in good faith, then they oughtn't feel like battered by…discourses into not being able to give that"

A, d: 'it also should be really easy for researchers to understand the difference" [between direct and indirect reporting of experiences]

A, d: "…we don't actually know the experience of this person because we don't have their testimony, we have the testimony of somebody who thinks they can speak for them, and the limitation is we have no way of knowing how accurate that is."

A , d: "I think it's really important that the scientists don't think, 'well they [a non-autistic person] said they had this experience [an autistic person] that means that's true'"

A , d: "It's a tricky one because I understand the argument that, as yet, people haven't found a really great way to include everyone, and if one way to answer that is we can't allow anyone to speak on their behalf, I can understand how that would hold back research that might end up bringing really useful things into the world for them, regardless of whether it's a super accurate representation of what that person would have expressed, but it's super important that people don't just take it as like a fact, that for the researchers they understand that this is just their interpretation of what they understand."

R, T, d: "I wholly agree with that"

R, T, i: "…certainly this is something that, when we were designing these sessions, there was somebody who I worked with and who is a volunteer who said, 'you need to split these up into direct and indirect', and I think that has been really helpful just having that cluster, to make sure they're not mixed."

A , d: "…a few things I did say were admittedly controversial when I spoke about how parents should have the right to say what they feel when dealing with their children, especially when the children have meltdowns as well"

P , d: "I'm a parent but I would not feel comfortable reporting my son's opinion or my son's personal view of something because I can't"

P , d: "…even if there's no opinion on why it happened, the information needs to be there without the person's side of it, because I can't say how that made him [autistic son] feel, and I can't, also say how that made me feel"
Peer support

A, P, g: 'it's to give people the language, you know, by reading the other people who can themselves write, and part of this is not just about knowing, or articulating, that you have your own sensory issues and how to pinpoint them, but learning how to self-advocate, learning what strategies can help. So, if this is going to be a very responsible platform, it really must help that side of things, as well as the other."

A, P , d: "…one thing we're trying to push in Scotland, and increase resource in, is understanding the importance of peer support and peer mentoring, so autistic people supporting autistic people…so this could be an opportunity for the platform…to position it in that way."
Supporting parents and carers

P , d: "…it's sort of like that thing on aeroplanes, you know when people say – remember when we used to travel on holiday – before lockdown – when they tell you about the masks coming down, and the carer needs to put the mask on before they put the mask on the person they're looking after."

P , d: "The parents do need support"

P , d: important to think about "the stress of parents"

P , g: "…I know there are parents who have it way worse than I do – I know it because I've met so many of them, and some people really, really need more and more help"

P , g: "…everybody needs just to spill it out, really."

P , i: " I can give a very clear example…of a Mum whose daughter was coming up to 11/12 years of age, reaching puberty…quite early, and the Mum was absolutely terrified that this girl who looked like a grown woman from the outside is extremely vulnerable…not just to the sexual predator, but to any boy who might find her attractive and might want to ask her out, even on an initially innocent basis – because she had really no idea about – even all the menstrual cycle stuff she was finding really difficult to explain…there's so many issues…parents like this do need to be able to share and get support because it is really difficult."

P , i: "There are people who don't have close-knit families, people who don't have other problems…so this is a big thing."

R, T, i: "…that's a lot to deal with"

P , g: "…right along the spectrum, it creates such pressure for the carers, and they need to be as strong as possible to provide the best sort of support to their family as they can."

R, T, i: "…really specific guidance?"
Accessibility

P , d: "…the phrase I didn't hear a lot of today was 'hidden' or 'invisible disability'

P , d: "…there's some interesting comments come through, particularly from [PA] about this"

P, i: "(R)'s concern was people on the spectrum who cannot communicate easily"

A, P , d: "…How we can actually support and find some resource to get that voice in there [people with communication differences]?"

A, P , i: "I asked him [autistic son] to find a way through it [communication challenges], and he did it by mind-mapping."

A, P , d: "I've learned to mind map from my son, in order to navigate things that I find too difficult to put into words, or that I overcomplicate, and so there's lots of different methods but we're not allowing it in the current form.

R, T, g: "Yep, I really hear that – I think one of the things that one of the things we've pretty much decided on is it's important to include lots of routes to communicate, so - lots of additional ways of entering information."

R, T, g: "…a lot of research has been done around accessibility which is open, you can view it on the repository…for that precise reason [that there are lots of different valid methods of communication]"

R, T, g: "I guess there's some difficulties around whether there is a group who aren't reached that way [using additional routes], and whether also the different ways people communicate can be examined in the dataset."

R, T, g: "maybe [it would be] worth doing a newer version of the platform… an improved one, to include more people?"

A, P , d: "It's like a 'Part 2' [the improved platform], but I'm resistant…to removing people, this marginalisation…because it's like a double removal of people, because they've been removed to the bit where someone speaks on their behalf, and then it becomes like I felt when I was in multi-agency meetings where I'm fighting to keep myself in the room, as well as my son who can't talk to anybody, he's not even really talking to me, and…I don't know what I want to say, and then it just becomes all fuzzy."

A, d: "I kind of think it sounds, it's really bad to be like, 'oh that's a phase 2 thing'. It's like saying, 'oh, that's difficult, we're not going to include you in the main thing'. 'Oh, that's complicated, we'll think about you later', that sounds really rubbish to me."

R, T, d: "Okay, thanks that's really useful to think about."

A, P , i: "…with the group of parents who moderate if stuff is submitted that way [in the way the autistic person prefers to communicate], cos the interpretation of it to help researchers, that's a very valid way of presenting your feelings."

A , g: "It strikes me that there's maybe 2 separate issues, which is that, obviously, how we can optimise the platform for people who are perhaps non-verbal, have non-verbal needs can participate in that, whether we're looking at different formats, different systems and functionalities to allow that to happen and how that happens."

P, A , d: "I have problems interpreting text [if] there's nothing visual to interpret"

P, A , d: "I keep saying non-verbal, I don't know if you're happy with that phrase."

P, A , g: "…there are people who are less likely to use the platform as it exists at the moment. I don't want to lock out the possibility that the parents or support workers could enable them to do it in a different way."

P, A , i: "I think we have to distinguish between non-speaking and non-verbal as well, because non-verbal is a subset of non-speaking, the non-speaking – a lot of them do think and words and thoughts and understand them, they just can't control their muscles and vocal movements"

P, A , d: "Yes, just look at 'The Lost Voice', the comedian, because he scripts himself, I said never misjudge or have a preconceived idea of someone's intelligence based on the ability not being able to speak"

P, A , i: "…my daughter's quite verbal with speaking, and she speaks and articulates quite well…[but that's] where sensory issues is more than just the impact the sounds and the lights have, it's also your ability to interpret your own internal emotions, your ability to communicate in words, find words and what they mean, so interoceptive as well, and then you've got alexithymia coming in, so it is hard even for some of those that are quite verbal and use their speech to communicate and articulate and understand their sensory things – so it's not just those who don't use words to speak is it? It's a whole."

P, A , i: "…my son…he snapshots it [what he communicates], so it's short, brief, and it's just enough for other people to get a sense of what's going on, but if he embellishes it or makes it bigger, he would dream about – he has significant nightmares of things – and all these experiences get muddled into one terrible nightmare – so he's learned through bitter experience that share so much but not too much, because then it replays itself"

P, A , i: "My daughter couldn't share anything with this thing [the platform], she's very [high] anxiety and demand avoidant, so she'd just so no. She also has great difficulty ever articulating how she feels."

A , R, A, i: "So with your daughter then, do you think something like this she would really guess struggle with, would she able to say: 'I didn't like this, but I don't know why'?"

P, A , i: 'No, she [my autistic daughter] needs…I think she's got a development to go before she gets there [saying she struggles with something in a platform]…she was diagnosed with a learning disability, so she meets a 'complex needs' category, and meets a 'low-functioning' category…but she ski-races nationally. (Categories were 'tongue in cheek')"

P, A , i: "she'll [my autistic daughter] need a lot of support and learning to even be able to access or engage with something like this [platform] or even understand her own thoughts and feelings "

P, A , d "In my own experience, if I look at too much text now, I marvel that I have any qualifications in anything, because I feel overwhelmed by it"

P, A , g: "…people who are accessing this platform, if there is too much heavy explanation of anything, how does that help the majority of people who prefer to look at things visually?"

P, A, d: Pdf version hard to read, not accessible

P, A , i: "I don't know how you make it inviting to them [developers] to help with this part of the project, because it does require them to acquire maybe a different type of interface or something to allow for the input of different information in different ways, maybe visual or whatever."

R, T, d: "…I can really see the argument that it's important to do everything that we can to include people. It's just that are we realistically going to be resourced to do that better than somebody's own parent, who has found a route?"

R, T, i: "There were some people [in previous focus groups] who had autistic children who were non-verbal and maybe couldn't communicate in lots of situations where for many people it wouldn't have been an obstacle, and they were sort of saying, "well. I'm tired of my autistic child being excluded because he or she couldn't speak for themselves, and I want to be able to represent them."

P , d: "I think we want to try and offer independence of expression as much as possible"

P , d: "…are there…things other than words, of expressing stuff?

P , i: "…with this parent's group I go to which is just for girls, the girls – all the little girls who come (and sometimes they're not so little) …do all sorts of arty and crafty kind of stuff to express themselves.

P , i: "[Good for autistic people to be able to] …vocalise…in some sort of way, whether it's a video or a picture"

P , g: "…not everybody has that support at home, or in different environments. We just don't have it – it would be great but we're just not that type of society, unfortunately there's just not a lot done [for autistic people with communication differences]."

R, T, d: "…there's a lot of social infrastructure around this, that we're designing a website but really the website is in the context of the society that we're in, and so maybe there's something about how we disseminate it."

R, T, d: "…maybe we need to talk to professionals who support maybe non-verbal autistic people, and that's a group that we need to…get on board, so we make sure that the website is really available to people"

P , d: Yep, absolutely,

R, T, d: …in terms of publishing stories, having that whole range of people's preference in terms of how they submit their story, in terms of having spoken things, drawn things, written things, I think that's really good for anyone to learn about autism as well and just how diverse it is."

P , d Yeah, yep

R, T, d: "It's really tricky and really important. This particular part [inclusion] is a real tangle I think"

P , d: Yeah, definitely

R, T, d: "…it's [accessibility is] such a complex thing"

R, T, d: "the designer for the project did a lot of work on creating accessibility…we made that a priority of the design work"

R, T, d: "[we] came up with all of these different options"

R, T, d: "…drawing was one [option], so you could potentially come on and use your phone and draw what you're feeling, express yourself in that way"

R, T, d: "upload a video [was one option]"

R, T, d: "speak…was another [option]

R, T, d: take or upload a picture]

R, T, d: "… just writing text…is obviously unideal for lots of people"

R, T, d: "…the more things you add, the more cluttered the user interface is, and then at some point that can become overwhelming for some autistic people who find just having too many options difficult – so there was a balance there."

R, T, d: "… there's a balance in terms of, sort of I really don't want to imply that we'll do the, sort of, second round because non-verbal people come second – it's just that there's a core function of the platform that needs to be developed first before that can be added."

R, T, d: "What will be useable for research is another balance"

R, T, d: "…I guess where I'm really struggling…is however many options we add eventually for ways of people communicating, there's a whole set of skills…or abilities around being able to access the platform in and of itself"

R, T, d: "…the need potentially to really work with whole social systems or even institutions when we put this out, to make sure that we actually can get people using it."

P , d: Yep, absolutely, yeah, -

A, P, i: "regardless of whether or not you can communicate, verbalise yourself through speech, doesn't mean that you can understand your own sensory issues…it doesn't mean you can articulate them: there's interoception issues, there's alexithymia"

A, P , d: "I have trouble writing. I can write, but I've got a difficulty with that, so words are not natural for me: I'm more music, and positions. and body language, so that's how I communicate my feelings, so once I start speaking, I struggle to stop, and that's why I'll go into a little monologue then be quiet"

A, P, i: "if you do admit some forms of editing information for non-verbal people have a terminology they would want to use, by forming it visually through images or whatever"

A, P, d: "Are there people in our community who we haven't spoken to yet who have the ability to help design the platform, but just don't know that it needs any extra elements? So how are we reaching out to people who may have these skillsets instead of having to go backwards by getting a new company on board and all this sort of extra smozzle that goes with it?"

R, T, g: "…we thought also, responding to your point as well, [A], that there was something sort of about – there's a whole social infrastructure surrounding who gets to take part in things, and maybe reaching out to supporters or people with expertise to find out how to help people use this platform"

R, T, i: "…it's about people as well about how we design it"

A, d: "find ways to make people more able to use it [the platform], and not as a kind of a nice-to-have, this is essential"

A, d: "I am so conscious that I have had so many privileges and opportunities in my life, that since being diagnosed I've been able read scientific papers and I've sought out information where I've had an understanding of a social model of disability"

A, i: "…while I think everyone should work towards a better understanding of this stuff, loads of people have to think about keeping a job and putting food on the table, so it kind of doesn't surprise me if some people have not had the same opportunity to educate themselves that would produce the kind of constructive responses that I think they ought to be able to produce"

A, d: "…it just seems to me that those factors might combine [not having access to education and being excluded if they use misinformed language], so that the people excluded are those who have already been excluded from the sorts of opportunities to have the education about disability rights that I wish they'd had, but I haven't given it to them."

A, d: "…it's really important to find a way that people can give their own opinions on things, and finding a way for them to be included is prioritised, at the same level, rather than just, 'oh, we need to find any answers to just fill our research out'
Inclusion

A, g: "we…discussed a lot about the subjective nature…the personal nature of what is uploaded to the platform"

A , P, d "…normally we don't have platforms like this, so can we do something to get a bit creative to increase the value of the platform to make it more inclusive?"

A , i: "I'm not non-verbal, but if I was and if I was updated on how thing was going and it was like, 'yeah, we're going to think about you next', it would kind of probably be like, 'well isn't that the problem to begin with'"

A , g: "I understand where this is coming from [concerns about non-verbal people being excluded or made to wait], but the reality is that this going to be a developing project, and as a project as a whole you want to help as many people as quickly as possible, so getting it out in some form quickly rather than perfecting every aspect of it, and then getting it out later, in a broad sense makes more sense."

A , d: "…while everyone still gets to say their piece to the researchers, your moderation bottom-line has to preserve the ability for everyone to contribute"

A , d: "…I don't know if this is still valid, considering I haven't really done research in about 3 years, but right at the start it [the presentation] was talking about how non-verbal people don't get heard as much, and as a result don't appear in research – that appears to only be discussing qualitative research, that there is far less of in autism."

A , d: "I also found that there was a gap between who [autism research] was covering – more severely autistic people tend to be looked into more than more high-functioning, from what I could gather."

A , d: "…obviously, if we're talking just about experience and research into experience, fair enough, but I'd say that scientifically there's an overall better understanding of less functioning autism than there is of high-functioning autism."

P, A , d: "…I think we're a long way away but if a platform like this is going to be inclusive, the only way we can say it is if there's a huge effort, parallel, into supporting ways to hear the voices and the thoughts of [non-verbal and non-speaking autistic people]"

P, A , d: "Yep, even if it's moving slower"

P, A , d: "…you have to build that [inclusivity] into the resource, but it will take more time in order to do this"

P, A , d: "…the benefits of sharing other stories of the non-verbal voices – somehow that isn't getting across enough"

P, A , i: "…is this not a moment to bring on another set of people who wish to volunteer their time?"

P, A , i: "…where my daughter is at the moment, I think I'd have to say, no I couldn't really speak for her experience, because she doesn't even want to talk about it with me, she doesn't even go there with me, so it would be very much my view"

P, A , i: "my [autistic] daughter, despite being very articulate about some things, is not able to talk about any of this, is not aware of any of this"

P, A , d: "…[there is] the risk of oversimplifying – sensory issues is all about…the whole bigger picture about my daughter understanding her feelings, understanding what she is feeling, putting them into words, let alone understanding what to do about it."

P, A , d: "…when she [R] was describing her project… I didn't see the word 'inclusion'. I put it in the chat, but the idea of the platform is to foster positive inclusion."

P, A , g: "…because I work for disabled co-production, we use the word "truthfully inclusive", and you may question what I mean by that, and it means leaving no-one out, there's no possibility, because everybody has somebody that can help them put their voice forward."

P, A , i: "Yeah, one thing, just, I was looking at what was sent round, and I think it was sent to us all, and it's about, how do we make sure that it is inclusive?"

P, A , d: "How do we ensure that all voices are heard?"

P, A , d: "I've done some dreadful faux pas, like, 'why is that presentation going on, why is there so much audio description', and then, during the introductions, there's someone who's visually impaired, and they go, 'that's for me', and I go, 'huh!'"

P, A , d: "…That could be any autistic person thinking; 'why are there so many visuals'…and it's because it's got to encompass everyone."

P, A , d: "[The problem] may be the others…more than you…if they can't believe that you didn't do it maliciously"

P, A , g: "…there's still this huge silence [around inclusion]"

P, A , d: "What I find is there's this huge…apathy, and nobody really warns you, so how do you realise and form an opinion and self-awareness?"

P, A , d: "'Mentalisation' is a word that I find useful…being aware of what you can do that might have hurt someone else, and putting yourself in their shoes: if that was you, how would you feel?"

P, A , d: "I would bring in double empathy here…naturally, understanding different people come from different perspectives, and have differing needs, and different experiences, and they will approach things in different ways and respond to things in different ways – so if I put my foot in it, like that example there (PA), what I then do is just…let everyone know that I'm on a learning journey, and say 'thank you for reminding me'."

P, A , g: "…it's really tricky, isn't it, because we are where we're at, and now we're trying to have this thing where we're trying to give the voices of all, but we've not actually put processes and places in society at a general level"

P, A , g: "…we're jumping ahead into a model where we haven't built the infrastructure or…methods for it"

P, A , d: "I'm not sure what the timeframe is of this project…there needs to be research into exploring how we get to hear the voices of more [autistic people]."

P, A , d: "…also where in this, as [A] has said, are the co-occurring conditions?"

P , d: "…every person on the spectrum has got a unique perspective."

R, T, g: "…there might be some things that just lots and lots of people say, and there might be some things that are very different, and it's important to communicate…just because you've met one autistic person doesn't mean that you now understand the whole autistic experience"

A, P, d: "I think we've also got to realise that making this an inclusive platform is more than just including those that don't communicate through words, or who are non-verbal, but also the important role that peer groups will play, as well, so people can go on and read other, Become more self-aware, become more able to articulate into words" A, P, d: "…we're talking about making it [the platform] really inclusive, but until people have an understanding of it themselves and can articulate it, they're not going to be putting it on the platform"
Socio-economic

P , i: "I don't know anything about the sample of people who you've got here today, but it probably isn't a very broad spectrum of class or social attitude"

P , i: "as [P] was suggesting, there's so many domestic situations which are onerous and where there's no understanding at all."

P , i: "I try to understand, and I feel bad about my inability to do that properly, but there would be many other people who haven't even got the time, the luxury to do that"

P , g: "…people are struggling on so many levels, not only just this year, but in general…family groups are fragmented, work situations are collapsing"

P , i: "…people I think are struggling to put food on the table, never mind thinking about what's going on in somebody else's mind, I mean we're fortunate because we're aware of the situation because it is difficult."

P , i: "…how close is it [autism] to mental health? Is it a cause of mental health problems? …Well, it's probably not a result of them, but…co-morbidities are everywhere"
Age

A , g: "…in a totally not-ageist manner, it's also very generationally based [what people would think of as offensive]"

A , d: "I know that my grandfather has opinions that shock me…even he's [my father's] got different opinions to me."

R, T, d: "How would we make it so the differing generations could feel comfortable on the platform? Do you have an idea where you would want to strike that balance?"

P , d: "It's difficult to tell"

P , d: "It's going to be a challenging thing to do"

(P, d): "I was just working on another writing project with somebody and we got to loggerheads because…I was using long words and they were saying this is not going to sell if I'm using long words, and I'm thinking, 'no but the long words can be the correct words…and then we get the whole, should we be dumbing down, to catch a broader range of people, and would other people think it's childish or a bit patronising?"

P , g: "I don't say this from an angry or anything point of view, I think there's an interesting place. There's so many things to do with technology and so on these days where young people know stuff that old people don't know'

P , g: "I think this is possibly the first time in the human experience that this has ever happened…because it's always been, "I'm older than you, I know more than you". In many ways that was true, but it's not anymore – "

P , g: "No, not at all, not at all – "
Gender

P , i: "…but then again you have a situation like (P)s son, my daughter – for a start they're male and female, which is a massive canyon between the two."

P , i: "I've got two other daughters as well, neither of whom have ASD, but having grown up one of 3 brothers, and the only female I knew for many years was my Mum, there are …gender complications."

P , i: "…when I mention it in front of [my autistic daughter], she gets annoyed because she doesn't like this older person's way of seeing things in a more binary style"

P , i: "…because she's [my autistic daughter] young she can understand the spectrum of gender and sexuality, and all these other sorts of things, but I…because of my age maybe, I try hard, but I don't really get it, and that's another thing which I think comes into play as well"

P , g: "…there's certain things, when you reach a certain age, you shut off from a more open, modern day approach."

R, T, d: "…is that [age differences] something you're saying should be taken into account in the way that the code of conduct is written, or is that something you would put into the training?"

P, d: "I think certainly in the training"

P , i: "…if you're over 35, there's some things the younger generation, in addition to the ASD affecting them will see differently."
Glossary

A , g: "I think in order for…it be clear it may offend someone but not everyone, a glossary should be present, saying 'ASD' means this, 'high-functioning' means this, 'low-functioning' means this, etc. – just to clear that up with some people."

A , g: "I think there would be a place for a moderator-approved glossary of certain terms, because otherwise somebody could be constantly objecting to the term 'ASD' when, as of now, 2020, I think a lot of people will still use that term and will do so with good intentions.

A , d: "I think that's [learning about others] almost a benefit of this [platform], so that's why I would suggest the glossary is there on the top of the home page or on top of the entry table, because it also gives an opportunity to educate people how to discuss these things and these sorts of conditions."

A , d: "Yeah, you could even flag, like, these are the sorts of things that you could edit – like if you just change this thing, to this other one, it's fine."

A , g: "…we discussed potentially having a terminology glossary or something along those lines to…enable people to help… understand ways of communicating and how their share sounds".

A , d: "I think in order for…it to be clear it may offend someone, but not everyone, a glossary should be present, saying 'ASD' means this, 'high-functioning' means this, 'low-functioning' means this, etc. – just to clear that up with some people."

A , d: "I think there would be a place for a moderator-approved glossary of certain terms, because otherwise somebody could be constantly objecting to the term 'ASD' when, as of now, 2020, I think a lot of people will still use that term and will do so with good intentions."

A , d: "I think that's [learning about others] almost a benefit of this [platform], so that's why I would suggest the glossary is there on the top of the home page, or on top of the entry table, because it also gives an opportunity to educate people how to discuss these things and these sorts of conditions"

A , d: "Yeah, you could even flag, like, these are the sorts of things that you could edit – like if you just change this thing, to this other one, it's fine"

A, d: "…a glossary [is] almost essential…to find a different way where people may refer to their condition, and ways that are considered appropriate and not A, d: "…don't use the word 'retard' for example, because probably only 30 years ago that would have been the way some of us would have been referred to"
Segmentation

A , d: "…in terms of it being a welcoming place…you [Researcher] mentioned the potential to bring in children, the potential to bring in parents, letting their children use the platform, and I do wonder whether there is something around user segmentation, and perhaps treating children slightly differently. I don't know whether that's possible."

A , d: "I just wonder whether there does need to be a slightly different policy, or some users potentially being able to see or not see certain things…because it would make it a more welcoming place for parents and children."

A , d: "It is [segmented censorship], because…in that initial form that you showed us there is a date of birth entered, but obviously if parents are making an account and not children, um, then yeah I think if a parent's signing up, they may be able to state that their children's seeing this as well."

A , d: "Does it [segmentation] mean therefore that certain things like software get introduced? Like if a parent was using a computer and therefore they logged in to the form itself, they could click on a feature that says…something along the lines of 'parents in the room', or 'parents online'…and there would be circles that would get flagged up [so] they themselves don't need to see it [a particular post] as a result of clicking on that feature, and it's a better way than trying to enforce public censorship."

A, d: "I…wonder whether this is actually a kind of place for a hierarchy or segregation of different kinds of uploaders, because obviously this platform was initially about non-neurotypical people uploading experiences, and obviously then we want to be getting a cross-section of the community including parents, other people in the community who have some interest in this process."

A , d: "I think fundamentally the priority is around non-neurotypical people and their experiences. So, I was wondering actually if you would want a different level of functionality or level of autonomy for those users?"

A, i: "…for example, for parents, more reminders could be built into the platform, or greater kind of functionality…so they can really kind of take a step back and think, 'okay, is this really what I'm saying in the heat of the moment. or something that in the cold light of day I probably wouldn't have said', and maybe building some of that capability into the platform by nudges."

P, d: "I still think for parents there needs to be a separate place"

A , d: "…it definitely can be a separate place [on the platform] where they [parents] can do [share experiences]."
Platform design

A, P , d: "…a facility that uses ways that autistic people communicate themselves to get their feelings out, which might be, you know, mind-mapping, spider charting, could be painting, it could be anything, but it still records that experience.""

R, T, g: "…if we use, for example, machine learning to pull out themes, so basically, look at texts and take out some of the common themes to make suggestions on how to change environments…if something is maybe a video or a drawn picture, that's going to be harder and a different route"

A, P , d: "…in that…'what would make it better?', in that sometimes [people could put] tips to other people, whether those tips can be followed or not, or that they could be read ultimately by someone like London transport to make improvements – so that aspect of investment, why it's good to share your story with everyone, isn't made clear within the precursors or the build-up, so I think you need to put an extra thing in there."

P, A , g: "…there will need to be multiple types of delivery of the guidelines, so there could be little intro videos maybe"

P, A , g: "…having that multiple different picture format, video format, written format – "

R, T, d: "…one thing at the beginning is that you could have, 'are you supporting someone else?" to share an experience, and then if you tick that box, you could then have a set of guidelines including, 'don't include your own interpretations of their experience'."

P , d: "maybe there was a tick-box when you started writing to say that you were reporting on behalf of someone else, so that was flagged up right away"

P , d: "you're aware that somebody else has typed that for somebody"
Segmentation

A , g: "… we talked about segmentation of users"

P , g: "if parents were concerned [they] still need somehow to get support."

P , d: "We currently came to… not really a conclusion… that maybe parents should have a separate section in which to communicate, so that people who are on the spectrum and are able to communicate for themselves can do"

A , d: "Perhaps, if we are talking about subsections… people with additional neurological conditions having their own space would be great, because I often find it very hard to separate which of my issues or my challenges are caused by what, and obviously the same goes for other ongoing conditions and mental health as well.

A, P , d: "maybe it would be a good idea to have an autistic voice section plus a non-autistic voice section."

A, P , d: "…parents can be autistic too, so I don't think it's parents [which should be a distinct category]"
Communication strategy

A, P , g: "…within that thing of the two boxes that you've got that says 'share with researchers' or 'share with everyone', what's the investment if you share with everyone? It's not made clear how much benefit there is to everybody"

A , g: "I…feel that that's…a problem of explaining to people what the platform is for…that a lot has been done with the moderation process…and it's for gathering experiences. I think a lot could be done…"

A, d: "I…feel that that's…a problem of explaining to people what the platform is for…that a lot has been done with the moderation process…and it's for gathering experiences. I think a lot could be done…"

P, A , d: '…the video that was done…by the actor with the experience of the tube journey, I feel that's all very well and good, but I think there should be an update…which is the experience of entering into a room, and the things that happen within a room…that actually does include all the people who are severely sensorily triggered. I don't know how that would be done, but almost the one for the tube is what I would probably expect to see about autism, but does it illustrate enough?"

P, A , d: "I did see one [a video] actually about someone just going into a room with friends, and then the party got a bit bigger, and showing them how they were feeling. It was done – I can't remember, a little while ago now."

P, A , d: "…the autistic viewpoint could be the dominant one on that platform, [but] that may not happen. I think the extent to which that may or may not do depends on how it was rolled out, how it was positioned and marketed, and if you do strive and there are efforts to bring in wider autistic people into the community wanting to use the platform and supporting them to do that."

P , d, i: "[autistic daughter with epilepsy has] done a few cartoony graphics like things, showing what it's like to have an epileptic seizure. And I'm wondering if there are these kind of visual representations of what it might feel like inside the body of somebody having an autistic meltdown."

P , d, g: "there is one…she [autistic daughter] often illustrates to me, which is very easy for men of a certain age, like me, to understand, is all this sensitivity to hearing, because you know that men, I'm sure women as well, but as men get older you often hear them say, "Oh please stop this noise I can only hear one thing". I'm sure it's the same thing with women, but they're probably just much better at dealing with it."

A, P, g: "… it's how you articulate it isn't it, because I think that is when you put it out there and market it."

R, T, i: "The thing that I think is important is that the public posting is part of helping others learn about themselves, or about their friends or colleagues who are autistic as well, in exactly the sort of way that [PA] was saying, and I think there's maybe a difficulty that we have with this platform of sort of conveying that."

A, d: "That's necessarily clear when you've got the public part of it…it might just be the way that we've been discussing it over the whole day, that I don't know what the purpose of this is exactly – but it doesn't make perfect sense to me" A, d: "…if people are aware [the platform is for research] before they post, then they are more likely to think, "okay, this is useful for research" A, d: "…just really emphasising what it [the platform] is about and emphasising that it isn't just a place to vent about your difficulties, it's a place to explain them."

A , d: "I think that's a factor of making people understand what they're here to do"
Moderation flow

A, d: "I think where the moderation process has to be really clear, is you're asking autistic people to socially communicate with you, knowing that from my perspectives that's one of the things that I struggle the most with, and while not trying to break any rules I may break some rules through my weakness"

A, d: "…the moderation would have to be a very clearly defined system with processes already in place"

A, d: "…in the event of the platform being popular, then there would need to be a very mechanistic and structured moderation process simply to enable the flow of commentators and the moderating process to…work effectively"

A , d: "…people should be welcome to say what they wanted to say, but…have a mechanism where people can understand that this isn't the place for emergency cries for help – not because no one cares, just because a semi-slow process that goes through moderation is just not the place to go for that."

R, T, d: "It's really great, it also helps us with the fact that it's going to be really difficult to moderate all the posts and so we're going to really need to set expectations that it might be quite slow"

P, A, d: "I'm online on Autistica's online forum, so there's a team of us trying to work around the clock, although it's live, it's not withheld, although we do approve posts and…comments"

P, A , g: "I know it does make it more difficult [withheld postings], and so there isn't really that time issue on this [platform] as such"

P, A, d: When we do it [moderate], it alerts us to what we call 'reported content', and then we get a notification as moderators to go on that, and it isn't conditional on all of us moderators going on there, it's conditional that say two people go on, and they'll do voting, but generally on that one it's an individual reporting that they're offended by something, by whatever criteria, and other people vote. And in that we only get snapshots because there's usually lots of long threads of what this thing is, whereas we would see pretty much the entire log, or whatever it is, and then people were voting on that."

P, A, d: "A very good point that helps us to authorise, to moderate, is to have particular words put in that creates an alert, we have that."

P, A, d: "One thing that helps [with the Autistica forum] is, because Autistica becomes more and more established, they call a lot of people, so over 12,000 members in just a few years: the members are coming up a curve too to notify us, and that's what (PA) I think was saying, and I think that's very important to be built in too, because I think there's a risk"

P, A, d: It's quite dangerous to assume that even a small group of moderators in such a new project would be able [to moderate well]: to think it's almost self-learning"

P, A, d: "If I was wanting to go for the jugular in something I post it'd be very specific personalities, but that would be totally destructive"

A , d: "All the concrete and abstract debates we've been having, what this comes down to, is how we do the moderation process?"

A, d: "I think also, in terms of that process, if it does turn out to be a fairly or highly popular platform, then that process will need to be fairly standardised and methodical, because you can't be making too many discretionary decisions, it just isn't going to work."

A, d: 'If it's lower engagement, then it might be better to have a bit more discretion, but if it's as popular as we hope then we may need less."

A, R, A, d: "I wonder what the process would be the other side? Do people want that post taken down instantly, do they want to know what happens afterwards?"

A , d: "…I think it would be good to see…a workflow chart of the moderation process, because I think it would be good to work through that and sort of visualise that on a more systemic level."

A, d: "I think you're right: a process flow of which fields need to be filled in."

A, d: "it's [moderation is] gonna be something that develops over time"

A , d: "I think there's obviously a very fine balance…so I think we need a kind of fettered moderation policy, and one that's kind of responsive…it grows with precedent, and works out what does work and doesn't work, and would need to grow with time too I would say"

A , d: "…a kind of written constitution then in that regard"

A , d: "It's [moderation] definitely something that needs to be a consistent work in progress."

A, d: "…you could have a process where it takes your post and it…gets quarantined overnight, and that could help the fact that obviously there's not going to be a whole warehouse of moderators waiting for comments coming in…so you post it, and you know it'll go live 24 hours later so you can sleep on it."

A , i, d: "I know many people, such as [A], would definitely disagree with me in this particular subject, you can't always police people's ability to say what they think in different situations…what offends me may not offend…and vice versa"
Quantity of posts

A , R, A, d: "I wonder if anyone has any thoughts if somebody posts, I don't know, four times a day every day, and they kind of got one voice coming quite loudly, as opposed to somebody might do once a month or every now and then, or something which has strongly influenced them: if there's a way of kind of balancing between the two to get a good level?"

A, d: "I think quantity doesn't always interact, or isn't always a correlation with the quality of the post" A, d: "…don't exclude anybody, people should be free to comment as much or little as thy like" A, d: "I think to be honest if people post loads, that's great, but if they want to interact with it very little, that's absolutely fine"
Self-moderating the posts you share

A, d :"…potentially adding little pop-ups before they actually post to be like, "are you sure you want to post that", so having this little moment to stop and think"

A, d: "…for me…it comes down to the devil's in the detail about how they…[human or robot moderators] can flag, filter, tag, group posts, so that people can…self-moderate.

A, d: "I keep coming back to: in my former job, I used to write procedures and processes, and thought about, 'What would you need to have in place in order to categorise and censor things so that people can protect themselves?"

A, d: "I always go with, if I write something, sleep on it, and still stick to it then it's probably about right. And if I write on it, sleep on it, and change my mind then I've probably made a mistake." A, d: "And I also think that part of it is in the sort of, nicking [A]'s idea he said about behavioural nudges…trying to get the writer to not vent and just tap away and hit send, is if they have to sort of categorise it in some way, so – this is a topic about parenting, is it a trigger?... if they have to do some additional little steps, even tick-boxing, but additional steps or drop-down categories."

A, d: "…you would say actually, 'I would rather this wasn't in the public domain on reflection', so it's still there but it's no longer publicly visible. If that was sort of one way maybe you could do that – hive it off from the public view, because obviously that functionality is already there because it's been designed that way already."

A, P, d: "I don't know If there's any self-editing, because when I first put a couple of things in, I didn't exactly like what I put, and when I went back to see if I could edit something, I don't think I could, I don't know if they've changed it since then"

A, P, d: "…helps to look at other things on the platform, when people start to discuss something, I can go back in and edit it [my experience], and then I look at it and go, 'that's fine, I'm happy with that', I let it go."

A, P, d: "I can always think of an example where I think I wrote something that was okay, and then somebody will point it out to me and I'll go, 'oh yeah, you're right'".

A, P, d: "…I've done those Google-maps things. You preview it before you say, 'go', so you write it, you're invited to have another look at it, that's an opportunity to see it there, there's literally something like a 15-minute window where if you've submitted it and you still don't like it you can go back and edit it. So, the chances of it being viewed in that time are pretty low, or less than that, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, whatever you want, that gives time for it to be self-moderated before it gets posted."
Self-moderating the posts you view

A , g: "…part of that [moderation] probably would be eventually a categorisation, so that people can essentially avoid what they don't want to see"

A , g: we talked about, "…potentially the way words could be filtered, people who don't want to see certain things"

A , d: "I…think that…even though I'm an adult and…I don't need filters… sometimes if you know you're still processing something that happened to you, you might not want to view something on a certain topic at that time, it's not like 'block it forever', but, 'just for now, please don't show me anything that relates to assault'"

A , d: "One of the things that I think might help that and I don't know if we've spoken about it explicitly is being able to filter."

A, d: "I can equally well have bad days, and so for me if I was coming to this [platform], having some ability to say, 'okay, today, for me, this topic is triggering for me so I want to screen that off"

A , d: "I think some of the successes of the platform will be in terms of how well the moderation evolves, allowing people to self-moderate: I can make a choice today, I don't want to see this type of post, and…I might want to see it tomorrow…in that kind of way, so that the users aren't harmed by it."
Flagging comments

A, P, d: "…potentially building in buzzwords that automatically flag [a post] to the moderators"

A , d: "I'm assuming users have the ability to flag something if they do find it inappropriate."

A , d: "…collecting data from that [flagged comments] would be a good way to continue editing, moderation, and deciding what is and isn't okay"
Rating systems

A , d: "…giving, in posts…U or 13+ ratings"

A , d: "Potentially [giving posts ratings]

A , d: "I wondered if, what [A] was saying earlier about having filters would help with that [moderation for people who have children]."

A, P, d: "That's what we have as a Google Guide, benchmarks: 'master reviewer', 'master editor', 'master locator', and things like that…then I've got points: so I'm level 9, chasing level 10, but then it's always been an incentive to keep me going that users can look at my stuff and they can put likes: 'I don't know if that's relevant, but it's quite nice to see the 'like', or the 'useful', because it endorses my love of sharing what I think is useful for someone to know."

A, P, d; "…on Amazon they have helpful/not helpful, and that becomes the basic rating system there."

A, d: "If you do that though [have a helpfulness rating] then there does start to become a higher risk of things happening, although the risk in terms of liking's lower, and with that you start to build in a level of interaction, and we do know that certain like boxes can be used for kinds of bullying and mass downvoting and things like that, so you're starting to build in a level of interaction that would be a significant – you know, a legitimate but significant step, change of emphasis, I guess in terms of the platform…I would sort of, I think it would be fine, but just…recognising that that would be a big change."

A, d: "It's an interesting point I had not considered, but how would you feel if there was a thing to say, 'this user sharing this experience was helpful or unhelpful', people could click there but there would be no display of either – so there would be searches in the background…those risks that you described would be mitigated, but would there be useful research value in having that."

A, P, d: "…the other label that we have on Google Maps is number of users that voted and number of users for review, in different milestones, so I might have a ridiculous picture of a trainer in a shop window, (I mean it's ridiculous, that many views, so obviously it's been useful to a whole load of people, or not, we don't know), but you could have…posts that obviously have got massive views, so whether you can interpret that a moderator can because the content was really, really useful, because it has a solution in it, what could have made something better, and it's this amazing epiphany somebody has had, and you could use it, cos it's like the numbers."

A , d: "…if someone submits a hundred postings and then not found to have breached the rules in a malicious way…they could get like a rating – a high – …because you're going to have different levels of users, and there are going to be some users who are really engaged, and some users who do really need the full ts and cs and code of conduct and best practice and all that, versus, 'I don't know what I'm doing again, sorry'."
Recourse policies

A, d: "I think that it's really important in the context of this platform for there to be real, clear recourse policies, so what you need to do to report, I think it's really important that the user or the person uploading the comment has a say in some part of the process."

A , d: "…if there are real difficulties like that, then it's important to record people's responses for the science, but I think there has to be some kind of: "we run this platform, and it's important for us to follow our own code of conduct, so while we aren't going to exclude it from the science, we aren't going to publish it publicly"

A , d: [make it clear] "you're not going to be ignored by science but, so that we can maintain the project that we ultimately own and are responsible for, we don't feel comfortable having this published publicly because we think it might, you don't even say why, but it might stop other people feeling like they're able to contribute"

A , g: "…it might not be that they've done something maliciously, it could just be a communication issue."

A , d: "…where something falls foul of the moderators and doesn't get published, the person who's written it – is there a mechanism for them to change it?"
Moderators
Who should moderate?

A, P , g: "We had a lot of questions about the moderators, maybe the sort of skills and roles and how many of them there would need to be, and what they would need to be"

A, P , g: "…it's a new type of project, a new type of thing, we will need a mix of moderators, who can learn together and also share and develop"

P , g: "…we were talking about how it [the platform] would be moderated if there were parents moderating as well as autistic/non-autistic people and how that would work and if that would work moving forwards"

P, A, d "…if it's not an individual reporting it, does an algorithm pick up an offensive word or an offensive comment in a log according to the code of conduct, or is it reliant on other people who have already posted saying, 'I find that offensive?'"

P, A, d: "I'm a bit confused by the idea of a single moderator operating at any particular point, because any experience I've had of moderating anything, is…a shared responsibility"

P, A, d: "On…my digital platform…people report things and then you have a group of moderators who make a decision whether to amend something, or remove it, or everybody votes."

P, A, d: "…isn't it easier having two or three people together doing it [moderating]?"

P, A, d: "…a single moderator at any one point doing it by themselves seems a bit onerous for me."

P, A, d: "…obviously I don't have the answers…a big consideration is the sort of size and amount of comments expected, and I guess if they're having a lot of comments in, whether it's possible to have a team, or whether that would slow it down, or whether it's kind of a reviewed moderation."

P, A, d: "I think there should be more than one moderator definitely, for various reasons, not least because this is a very new thing: the fact that this is still very subjective, the fact that…not one autistic person is necessarily up with all the potential ways the code of conduct could be breached"

P, A, d: "…more than one mind, I think, has to be a part of that [moderation], and it has to be a group to be able to deliberate on things and share views"

P, A, d: "I don't know [what happens when there's a disagreement about moderation]. I've always been able to persuade people, if what they wrote that they thought was okay and someone else thought it's not okay, to see the long term."

P , d: "Who will moderate it then? Who will be the moderator? Will it be actual users of the forum, or will it be somebody else?"

R, T, d: Who will moderate the platform is still to be decided

R, T, d: "How important do you think it is that the moderators are autistic themselves?"

P , d: "…I think there should always be people who have an inside understanding of it [autism], and I just spoke to (A) just before [this session] – off camera so to speak about some of the stuff from your presentation, and there are some things that she noticed that I didn't."

P , d: "I think if it's closed off only to people with ASD themselves, it's already creating an exclusive club, which is not really what we want"

P , d: "we want to embrace everybody"

P , d: "I would have thought a mixture's good but with an emphasis that somebody with ASD is always involved"

P , i: '…maybe someone would tell [an autistic person's] …story [on their behalf], and that might be really bad for someone who's autistic – so having a moderator who wasn't [autistic], they [autistic people] may feel somebody won't understand their story, they'll look at it from a different point of view…

R, T, i: "Part of the way I see it is there's this balance between…resource and the ideal representation."

R, T, g: "…it would be brilliant to have a real large, diverse, panel of moderators look at everything, and at the same time that takes time and resource".

R, T, d: "How do we find…the time and resource where people feel this [level of representation] is sufficient?"

P, d: "Would you use moderators of different ages then, is that something as well?"

P, g: "…an older moderator…may come across something they're offended by that a younger person wouldn't be…so [moderator's age] could make a really big difference actually to what gets used."

A, d: "…some people will post every day, some will post once in a blue moon, but you could sort of have…I think there are terms that I've heard before…a verified or trusted poster."

P, d: "It's about, are our moderators autistic as well? How they would look at [an experience] differently to somebody who was not – so if you've got autistic and non-autistic moderators, would they look at things differently in terms of what would and what would not offend people?"
Interactions between moderators and users

A, d: "[important]…the user understands why their comment was flagged, that they have the opportunity to query that as well"

A, d: "I would be quite tempted, if I were you, to say, "no we're not going to discuss it", especially if you have autistic moderators.""

A , d: "I just think we're talking about how not everyone does communicate in the same way, and the idea that that changes what I want to say, that may then be a chance for the moderator to say, 'well can you explain again to me what you were trying to say and maybe we can find a way together to help you say want you want to say'

R, T, g: "…people might make mistakes with their language, and a moderator might go, 'maybe could you rephrase that?'…they may be very happy to do so, they may be like, 'oh yes, shoot, I didn't know that I didn't think about that, yes happy to rephrase.' But what [A] is thinking about isn't, "there might be ones who say, 'no, no…that's my experience. By changing that, you're changing my experience, or cutting things out"

R, T, d: "I'm curious if anyone has any solutions to that."

R, T, d: "…to be perfectly honest, I think it's a very important and difficult piece of process that we're going to have to put in place"

A , d: "[we won't publish publicly]…for our own reasons, which we're not going to pretend are…the perfect, most egalitarian reasons in the world, they're just what we have to do to enable this project to keep going "

A , d: "I think it needs to made clear to them [people who have had comments moderated out] …because it could be really upsetting if they've been putting all this work into writing this comment that they feel very strongly about"

A , i: "…if my dad wanted to share something, my dad hasn't read a newspaper for years…the chances are that he'd accidentally use something that he had no idea was offensive, but then… if someone said, 'by the way, this term is outdated and people find it offensive for this reason', I can then imagine he'd be like, 'oh my god, I totally didn't know, and I'm not wedded to using it, I can totally now change it to what that thing is now called', and…you can see what he was trying to express, but equally he hasn't offended anyone."

A, R, A, d: "...and you think it's fine that if they submit something the moderators don't agree with, that will then be flagged to the person who submitted the post?"

P, A , d: "It's a more generalised approach to say, "what could be better?" This is where you'd obviously put the positive in."

P, A , d: "What we do on 'Next Door' is… when enough people…vote…[to consider removing a comment], usually the person is contacted and invited to amend it themselves"

P, A , d: [when people amend comments themselves], "then it's acceptable…and there's a learning process, and the person finds out it's not acceptable and maybe the reasons why, and then there's no question about that… rather than it kind of just goes, and the person feels like there's no point in posting anything else because it always gets removed."

P, d: "Would a moderator have the right or the permission to go back to the person who's put something up, and say, "look, can I help you put that in another way that we could then help you put that on the forum…?"

P, d: "[giving feedback] takes time"

P, d: exactly yeah – it's really hard to get that right

P, d: "If a comment was moderated though, what you could say to a parent is why: the input is really important, but you need to take the personal out of it; you could explain that the content's the really important part, but the actual emotion isn't - it's not the right format."

P , i: "…you [the moderator] might go back to the person who's put the post and she might say, "no, I put that because I am pissed off with the way someone treated me at school, so I don't need someone to make it sweeter."

A, d: "…because I'm coming from a kind of operational thing, how many posts are we gonna get a day, a week…? While I would like a high level of touch from a moderator, is that really possible? I suspect not."

A, P, d: "What [A, P] and I were talking about at the very end of the last session was…moderation has been given to someone, and you say, "do you really mean this, this may have come across in such and such a way? Would you like to revisit it? Would you like to amend anything?"

A, P, d: "Yeah, to be able to communicate that in a way that doesn't sound critical, but sounds kind of a more open process"

A, d: "I think what you said [A] about being able to edit changes, I think you have to be careful to show a level of transparency where changes are being made, because I think that…engenders change…without understanding the underlying reason why."
Moderator training and guidelines

R, T, d: "I think part of the guidelines needs to say, 'we're not going to edit people speaking about themselves', but may put back as the moderation, 'if you're feeling frustrated because of the actions of somebody else, this is not the place to capture that, and here are some good resources, here are some good places where you can go and support that purpose.'"

A, d: "…what if you want to say something on the forum and the moderator ends up having a bias against what you write in any way whatsoever? What if the moderator decides to take… a borderline extreme exception to what you write on this particular form, so what would the process then be if you think the comment is unfair or has been unfairly censored?"

R, T, d: "…I'd quite like to generalise that question to say, 'how do we ask our moderators, who are human beings and likely going to be autistic human beings, to be perfectly consistent in all of the decisions they make?"

R, T, d: "How do we come up with guidelines to be able to respond to examples like that: where there's a disagreement with the person?"

A, P , d: "…so there's an element of mindset there of the moderators too"

A, P , g: "…we've been making huge assumptions to think the moderators have all the skillsets to really know when language can be harmful, or there's a problem"

A, d: "I think there will need to be empathy of that situation, where it isn't somebody being bad, it has to be a two-way process"

P, A , g: "It does take a bit of longitude to get an understanding of whether something is ableist or stigmatising, or harmful, or to know certain language would go against the human rights ethos that we've come to expect, so there's a lot of getting up the curve for anyone."

P, A , d: "I think that part of the moderator's skillset will be not just saying, 'that doesn't meet this, sorry', but to be able to work with the person, with a workable solution…maybe just tweaking the language … it may just be lack of experience of the person who maybe wrote the post, and without that advice on how to word it in a much better way, potentially there could be valuable input on that forum not happening."

R, T, d: "…make understanding anger and allowing swear words part of the training…of moderators."

P , d: "that word "facilitate", is really key"

R, T, d: "It's hard…scaling from a group where you can individually facilitate, to …an online website [which] anyone can access"

A, d: "I think how we view it also involves the perspective of somebody who's doing something wrong, I think that has to be empathetic to everybody involved."

A, R, A, d: "Yep, I'd imagine there'd be a lot of training needed around that."

A , d: "I used to be one of those people that was like, 'oh no, I couldn't take it if someone disagreed with me, end of': I'd want to get rid of them, but as I've grown older in life I've…got more disciplined with it"

A, g "…there can be ways for people to civilly disagree with people… and yes, you can have differences, and you can disagree with someone. and still remain civil on these sorts of forums."

R, T, d: "I'm curious how to tell apart something that's a civil disagreement that's quite polite and reasonable and something that's less polite and goes too far."
Risks

A , d: "…on balance I think it would be good to do some stress testing to see what is the worst thing that could possibly go wrong with this platform."

A , d: "I deal a lot with people's worst impulses and behaviours, and it always takes my breath away in terms of how people find ways around the best thought-out systems."

A , d: "…it would be really good to think about, what's the worst thing somebody could possibly do, and what's the worst thing that could possibly go wrong? If everything goes wrong…what's our worst nightmare… I would definitely advise thinking about that in terms of this platform, because it some ways you don't expect the worst, so that would be my advice as well."

A , d: "I think there's no perfect scenario to preventing harm or risk, you can't eliminate that in relation to this issue, but one thing you might want to consider is including behavioural nudges, so, for example, things that come up saying, 'are you sure you want to post that', encouraging people to think more carefully before they click send, and building that into the website, encouraging people to take a step back."

A , d: "That actually makes more sense, at any stage of the process, just literally ask, 'are you sure what you've said is fully appropriate and you want to post it and blah blah blah, you know.'"

R, T, d: "It's hard…scaling from a group where you can individually facilitate, to…an online website [which] anyone can access."

A , d: "The kind of rapid response and deterioration of other posting sites like Reddit or social media doesn't seem to me like it ought to be a kind of thing that plagues the system if people understand what it's for."

A, R, A, d: "…editing on some platforms, say Twitter for example, has caused lots of problems in terms of not wanting to change the core content of things after it's posted. So, there would have to be, I guess, checks in place so that it doesn't get abused in a way."

A, d: "That's why I think, not only from a quantity point of view I think you've got to have it, but for the moderators as well I think you have to have some level of moderation from tick-boxing, grouping, tagging, categorising and all that, to try and encourage someone to put an effective post up" A, d: "…if you've got everyone just dumping, even with the best will but doing it badly, then the moderators will just be drowning in it" A, d: "…going back to the presentation, that post that [R] talked about there, back in the supermarket, the first one is what you want to see, but the bottom one is…the worst version of the same event." A, d: "The last line of defence is the human brain, I think – to protect the moderators"
Platform becomes too interactive

A , g: "… in terms of what could go wrong I think that we agreed that there's risks in most online forums and social media platforms"

A, d: "You're sacrificing…all the social media – there are no comments, which, obviously makes it safe, but it potentially stops a marginal post, or something that might be deemed really in the fine margins of whether it should be allowed or not, it can't deteriorate as I've seen so many other social media posts deteriorate."

A , d: "It doesn't seem to me to be like a Reddit thread that could run out of control. It's not a message board, it's not Twitter, it's not something that people can comment on"

A , d: "You are sacrificing all the social media – there are no comments, which, obviously makes it safe, but it potentially stops a marginal post, or something that might be deemed really in the fine margins of whether it should be allowed or not, it can't deteriorate as I've seen so many other social media posts deteriorate."

A , d: "…I think that a lot of the negative feedback you can get, this site isn't going to have that – so I hope that that would move people away from the unhelpful venting."

A , d: "…my hope is that this platform…it's not a back and forth."

A , d: "…there's no potential gratification from me commenting back, so I don't know if I'm over-emphasising, but I wonder if this will change how people will use [the platform]."

A , d: "I think there's a fear with that, that people might think that they won't get any questions so they can write whatever they want as well. It has a flipside to it not having responses."

A, d: "[A] made the point about there being a lower level of risk, obviously because there isn't that level of social interaction you would normally expect on a forum or a social website or something like that. However, it would be good to test that – and I think that's down to the design of the platform."

A, d: "…if, for example, the posts are…laid over each other sequentially, one under the other, but actually it could have the appearance of a forum, because people could see the comment below and decide to interact with them. I don't think the level of risk would be that high if it was properly moderated, but it might be worth just thinking about the presentation of the platform, and having a forum-style sort of responding, for example someone wouldn't like a comment and they would respond aggressively to that comment – whether that sort of situation could arise." A, d: "…you can see the other comments though: if a comment is uploaded onto the platform, you can see the comment, so there might be an impulse to respond to something that people see and don't like"

A, d: "I don't know how the design will work though, because if it appears in a forum-like way: if it's set up in a forum-like way, then people might be like – 'oooh, I don't like that, I'm gonna have my say'"

A, d:: "…you could get someone going on there, posting, and some really upset autistic person could go on and say, "I've just been to a website and saw a post which really upset me", someone will cleverly find a way to join the two, yeah you're right" A, d: "…that would put a lot of pressure on the moderators if they get inundated with that sort of thing."
Public posts causing distress to users

P, d, i: "…one of the main issues I think which crops up…I don't want to go on a forum and, if you like, from a parent's point of view whinge about how bad my life is, [and for] my child to hear that, and then to feel that she's done something wrong"

A , i: "…I think it is definitely important to protect, particularly those who may not naturally see those effects [of their autism on others], from discovering them, and then feeling that way [guilty]"

A , d: "I think some suggest that mental health issues are a symptom of autism, so there's going to be people who will want to write very personal stuff, and we were… discussing, what is the safest but the most open way to deal with those posts? and how to prevent people from reading something that is potentially traumatic and yet still making it available to researchers to see."

A , d: "[people might] …for example use different language, different terminology, have different ways of communicating, and that might be quite upsetting for another person"

P, A, d: "In that list of things that might be offensive, that might trigger people, I think 'placeism' isn't there."

P, A, d: "People might actually mention a specific place like a day centre they attend or a particular council support or something if they…have a very bad experience, but other people could have a very positive experience of that place."

P, A, d: "…they're [people who are spoken about] not there on the platform, they're not able to defend themselves"

P, A, d: "if other autistic users or others who potentially put a post in feel…'that's not my experience', [they may] feel it's invalidated because, "if they've just said all that then what can I say", and they may not even want to say anything"

A, d: "…my concern would be that if somebody was in a similar situation to me: they were getting in trouble at school, they thought that they were bad, but their parents kept reassuring them, and then they come online and they find that their parents are writing something negative, I feel like that could be detrimental to the way that person sees themselves for the rest of their lives"

A, d: "It strikes me that the issue, you know, you were talking about what if somebody uploads something which is, say, for example, a parent uploading something and then…it could be quite difficult or upsetting for a child, even if it was meant well"
Responses to moderation causing distress

A , g: "I think it could be really, really upsetting for some people if that happened [their comment was moderated out]."

A , d: "…my experience was that I was dubbed as "bad" throughout education. You know, you don't want a child going through that and then coming home and seeing that their parent thinks the same thing, or assuming that their parent thinks the same thing because of something their parent has said."

A, d: …Facebook, they've got all the money in the world, and a lot more money than you guys have, and they still haven't sorted [the moderation process]"

A, d: "…I imagine that, just knowing we have social media companies, I don't want to get into the politics, but if you look at social media companies who are hugely profitable, and what they're doing around potentially harmful content, I don't think this platform will have anything near that budget to help mop up any of the genuinely unintended consequences of a potentially triggering post"

A , d: "…we hope that people are going to become more open-minded over time, but things are also going to – political correctness is also going to get tighter"

A , d: "Some of the experience is maybe quite upsetting."

A , d: "How personal is this going to get [the experiences on the platform]? Because there may be people who are writing about abuse, or are writing about suicide attempts. Those are then triggers for others"

A , d: "…if I was to think that those two people [my parents] who always could see me for who I really was, were suddenly saying the opposite, then I do think it would have a profound effect"

A , d: "…my worry is that once someone makes a comment or discusses a situation…there's no control over who [or] how many people consume that content, and what effect it has on them."

A , d: "Yeah, I can see that as well".

A, d: "…the issue is if you have had a bad day, you're already stressed out, and you go onto this online platform where you're meant to be able to vent, and you suddenly see that your parents say that you've ruined their day, that's going to make you feel bad, personally. It's not about the community, it's about the individual that will be affected by their parents saying stuff like that."

A , d: '…if I was to see that at the age of 25 [parents' frustrations], that would knock my mental health down the road, because I still feel guilty"

A , i: "Well, that's a question actually about how is the person, in particular the child, actually going to know about it? Because chances are when their children are under 5 years old [they won't be able to read about their parents' frustrations]"

A , i: 'I live at home, I still have meltdowns at the age of 25, but there are some people who may still be high-functioning and be able to use this site but may not be emotionally high-functioning so they don't see that effect on their family, so they could then come on this site and see their parents saying the emotional effect, but they would be totally oblivious"

A , i: "they ["low-functioning" autistic people] would see that, yes, it [a meltdown] meant that we had to come home early, but that's all that meltdown caused until they see that [an experience], and then they're dubbed as bad by their parents."

A , d: "…if you…see that happening [people talking about suicide or abuse on the platform], would the moderators take action to make sure that person is okay?' Because if someone is literally saying, 'last week I tried to kill myself'…and they're putting that on a public place, that could very easily be their call for help, and that needs to be responded to."

R, T, d: "I think that these are really wonderful points [about posts concerning suicide and abuse], and I think I'm making sure that our process…gets in touch with somebody who is maybe looking for help or needs support."

R, T, i: "My feeling is that…making those experiences [about suicide or abuse] public probably does more harm than good, and so I would suggest taking a position where we get back in touch with the person who wrote it, but we don't make that post available."

A , d "I find that a bit troubling [censoring posts about suicide and abuse]…I understand the purpose of it."

A , d: "I would imagine that there's probably a situation where the resources don't allow it [the platform] to become a kind of emergency service"

A , d: "If those things do come up [around suicide or abuse], then there ought to be an opportunity to have people express what they're trying to say, but in a position where they're not feelings right on the edge of something dangerous."

A , d: "I think it would be good to…set the expectation that, if you are desperately in need of help, submitting a blogpost for moderation on this platform is probably not the most direct way of getting it."

A , d: "…obviously there should be places where it could be flagged that if you do need that kind of [urgent] support here's where you can get it."

R, T, d: "How do you give feedback on someone's experience [taking into account] that person who said, "it's my experience –"?"

P , i: "[The person who has content moderated out] might just be someone who's very frustrated, and they might just say, "…I'm really upset, I'm really angry…", because a lot of the time it's just getting rid of anger"

P , i: "…it might put people off using [the platform] again, and getting that truth again because after they have been moderated, maybe some people wouldn't do"

R, T, i: "…that's a good point"

R, T, g: "…there's so many different dimensions to a person that might mean that they might have a different subjective response"
Venting

P , d: "…parents need to vent, in the same way that everybody needs to vent – but you need to do it in a private way so you're not purposefully making somebody feel bad about themselves."

A , d: "… one of the things that makes me feel the worst is this idea that it's the platform for venting."
A , d: "…it seems really strange to me that that's the way that people would see it, and that there's a real burden on the researchers to make sure people are aware that this is not a place to come slag your child off, this is a place to research how to make things better for people"

A , d "…it's a collection of uses for research, and if that is emphasised in the correct way, I think you can avoid anger and issues like that."

A , d "…perhaps the way to deal with that would be to have a way to direct users to forums which do respond if they want to vent and they do want to get support."

A , g: "…if it's clear that that [venting] isn't what this site is for, then it becomes less of a potential problem I think, and for me I think that's what we need to emphasise – it's that this site is about collecting information for research, not venting."

A, P, d: "Yes, we've got platforms all over the place where parents go and vent and moan, and aren't particularly compassionate towards this disabled person" A, P, d: "…it's either going to be another platform that can fuel the negative narrative, the deficit, the medical model: the ideal…is not to be disabled, and we can cope with that in society, but disability is a nuance, an imposition, makes things less human, and we can platform that narrative too – and that's the one thing that we can't do."

A , d: "putting links to people that can answer questions, or links to actual forums where people do actually respond, is key to preventing people from coming on for the wrong reasons, ranting, and not getting any response, or whatever."

A, d: "I think it's really important, and it's troubled me that people have talked about the ability to vent, it seems completely inappropriate to me that this would be a space for people to come and vent"

R, T, d: "Thank you, I think that's really interesting, this kind of difference between policing emotion and not being a place where people can just vent – and balancing that is a difficult one."

P , d: "I don't think there's a place for venting within that main place to post. I think yeah parents do need to vent, but it shouldn't be in that forum: the emotion should be kept out of it. There should be a place to vent, 100%, but I don't think that's the place for it, because I think it just becomes emotional instead of actually what you're trying to get out of it."

R, T, d: "How do you make a rule for when something is venting, vs. when something is just saying that you have a response to a situation?"
Libellous posts

A, P , g: "…somebody might identify a location, a play centre or a building, or decide the person that operates within a building [has done something wrong], and criticise it almost libellously"

A, P , d: "perhaps you'd like to have that taken out [specific places] because, for instance, I wouldn't flag out to the National Autistic Society as being awful or something, because that's so co-dependent on other people."

P, A, d: "If it's [a place is] named, as if you were naming someone and potentially libelling them, I think place libelling can be brought."

P, A, d: "It's different having a go at London Transport or a hospital ward or something that's very generalised, but if you're going after a specific doctor, or councillor, or place that you use, then that could cause a real issue."
Vexatious or malicious posts

A, d: "There are situations in which I can imagine there might be somebody who doesn't interact with the platform in a sensible way, or in a potentially malicious way, so they might send lots of vexatious posts or something over a short period of time, at which point there probably should be…thought put into whether there needs to be policy around that." A, d: "I can imagine the situation in which…you might want to pick up the malicious posts or the 'not-taking-it-seriously' posts, so that's…one scenario" A, d: "I think there's a way that people could abuse that if what people are uploading are vexatious, are not engaging with it sensibly, or yeah, not with the right motives."
Posts becoming too open-ended

A , d: "I think if you have an open to just write whatever you want, about any experience you want, over your whole life, what people are going to think about most are the injustices which inflame some of the most unhelpful responses that we've discussed"

A, g: "…if you ask a specific question, they [contributors] might think, "yes, I did have an unpleasant experience at a train station," or, "when I got to university this is how I found the library extremely inaccessible to me": it might make people think about specific things rather than what is burning theme up inside in this one moment."

A, i : "…if everyone is just writing – when you're looking for a very specific quote, like an academic in a library…you're looking for a very long time to find a specific quote. I suppose researchers are only looking for specific situations, it's going to be hard to go through all of that prose just to find what you're looking for, and that's why from the start I suggested categorisation"

A, d: "if you're talking about a particular type of situation, a type of sensory overload…that's definitely something to think about"
Research fidelity/scientific validity

A , d: "…what I would take away is that, in terms of…a lot of the research, as [A] was saying, a huge amount of the research is primarily quantitative, and I think there's a huge amount of temptation to see this as someone autistic as being the subject of research interest"

A , g: "…we [A and R] were both in that thing, that slightly weird research thing, looking at the origins of autism, and the guy said it was basically like a medical condition, no different to obesity or something like that. I think that was pretty offensive and fails to capture the diversity and the benefits of autism and neurodivergence."

A, P , i, d "…you [R] mentioned that the majority of funding does go into the science of autism, and I think that's really where the issue of all of this is, and although this is a really good step towards changing that…it's not about finding a cure for a condition, it's about finding the best possible way for people to live with it"

A, P , d: "…hopefully projects like this will be the first step towards moving research away from just looking at the science, and start looking at the experiences as well, because it really should be 50/50"

A, d: "…that is why there is so little qualitative data, because you know you can't write your opinion on somebody's biology – it is fact"

A, d: "I think this a great stepping-stone, but I can see we need to keep pushing for more projects like this."

A, P , d: "I think that's another really big message to get out there…that there's more than one sort of data, and that includes the lived experience and the feelings of autistic people."

A, P , d: "…too often…how autistic people will explain, and often their perspective, is almost discarded straight away – it's considered 'not relevant' for data. You can't see it, you can't measure it, so it doesn't count as data."

A , d: "…when I did my research, my main one thing I did notice was the lack of qualitative research."

A , d: "…finding new ways to do research with people that are autistic is something that's always been at the forefront of my mind, as something that I'd really like to try and get into."

A , d: "…it's really exciting to see a project that's totally thinking outside of the box and taking that route that I'd have liked to take, but from a totally different direction."

A , d: "it's reassuring as well to see that I'm not the only one who's noticing these gaps in research, that there are other people who are thinking about it."

A, P , d: "…we didn't mention this, but I'll mention it as part of this [sharing discussion] … make some guidance how people could input their stories that would make the information more useful for a researcher."

A, P, d :"…it would be a shame if somebody shared a story, and we thought, 'ah, it would be so useful, if only they'd included this or that we could have used it in a much better way.''"

A , d: "…we need to balance then, obviously the need for it to be authentic and to be useful for research purposes, but also the need for the space to be as safe as possible"

A , d: "…the way that I've understood it is that people who are gonna do research based on specific situations and specific sensory issues, in the same way a conference does for papers, will you do a call like? Like, "we want to know your experiences of train stations"

A , d: "…there's loads of different types of research, which is…what we're discussing now; loads of different research topics. Would the site have access to seeing how many people have read each post, and could that then be used as data to see what is most popular?

A , d: "What kind of analytics are you going to get from site usage, how would maybe be used?"

R, T, d: "…we don't have plans to implement that [analytics analysis from site usage] just yet, because…there's a whole set of other ethical questions that come with [surveillance analytics]

R, T, d: "there's also a big element around, "what does it mean to be popular?" …just because something is popular, doesn't necessarily mean that it's the most important thing, so I think that I would personally say that's out of the scope of what we are trying to achieve with this project."

R, T, d: "…I very much hope that people will want to extend it and work on it in different dimensions, and be able to take that advantage forwards"

A, d :"…because this is a research platform as well, a lot of the information that is collected will need to be…accurately representative of how people are feeling and some of the experiences that they've had."

A, d :"it's supposed to be a…scientific project that gathers people's real experience…to censor that stuff because it's difficult to read, also means that you're then removing what is also a real part of people's experience, and that – even if it might be difficult - doesn't sound like it's good science."

A, d :'…as (A) said, if this is a scientific project about potentially trying to capture this information. It's undermining the scientific rigour of it if people are just talking about the birds and the flowers outside…"

A, d: "I can see why doing [posting] stuff that is excessively sensitive may not be honestly a good idea, but if we're still trying to find a focus on this idea that it all has to be available to research, for example, an archive section available only to researchers, where blogs that weren't allowed to be posted for moderation are still accessible, would resolve that issue. I mean they would all still be on the system…so making it only available for researchers would mean that users wouldn't get upset or triggered, but it would still be able to be used for good."

R, T, d: "It's quite nice that you said that [about non-public posts still being accessible to researchers], because that is actually part of the design of the system…people can choose to either share their experience just for research purposes so it doesn't go public, or they can share their experiences publicly, and actually if they want to they can say, 'I only want to post it publicly, I don't want it to be used for research', and I think that's catering towards people who have a mistrust of researchers but want to keep in touch with their community."

R, T, d: "…what I really like about where this conversation is gone, is that if we keep for research purposes posts that did not pass moderation, it allows us to reflect on the difference between the posts that do and the posts that don't, and we can sort of loop back to what (A) was saying earlier, that we may have to change our moderation processes as we go along, but if we're making sure to keep the ones that we don't post publicly, that allows us to do that process"

A, d: "The majority of it [autism research] is quantitative, which is statistics."

R, T, d: "…studies tend to look at one community of people…with particular skills and not another. So, there might be a lot of research into people with complex needs, but they don't tend to be doing the same things or being part of the same studies as the studies that look at autistic people that can engage more broadly with the world – ".

R, T, d: "…with our perspective as researchers, we would like to build a project that doesn't exclude either group [those with and without complex needs] – so that actually people can engage with it very broadly – and we may not succeed but I think the goal is to try the best we can…"

A , d: "…that's a good clarification and something that excites me to be honest"

A , i: "…with qualitative stuff, and…there was an example about making the transport network more accessible…are the answers not going to be quite different for people who have low support needs and people who have more complex support needs…so wouldn't it make sense to have…different studies?"

A , d; "…why would you have to shove everyone in one [study], so long as you were making sure you were looking out for both groups of people, or multiple groups of people?"

A , i: "I suppose that probably comes down to funding [why you would address different groups in one study], like if you're trying to look at both that's probably going to come down to funding to do two separate research [projects] on one topic"

R, T, d: "…where you draw the boundary between the two studies [about people with different subtypes of autism] is a bit of a very artificial separation, and it's missing the complexity of this constellation, these…multiple dimensions…and so having the researchers choose a separation is potentially quite an artificial way of customising projects"

R, T, d: "…if we can't find a way that works for everyone, we may end up doing something like that [breaking up the study]"

R, T, d: "I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that separating people into two separate studies is easier to do."

A, d: "I think if you're researching a specific area, then you need to be able to find just what's written about that specific area – "

P, A, d: "While you're doing this platform, investing in all this, use it for the maximum possible, so it's giving qualitative data to the researchers and providing a good forum for autistic people to understand about strategies as well."

P, A, d: "It's very important to not just say, 'tick an autistic or non-autistic' box: [it] has to be autistic, formally diagnosed, or self-identified, otherwise the research information is not very useful."

P, A, d: "So this case, even the one the autistic person has drafted, the way the researchers read it, 'flickering lights is a problem', and yeah it's true flickering lights [are] often a problem, but we don't know that here. Okay, you can always jump into the most likely answers as an explanation without actually knowing, so it would throw out the research terribly even if the autistic person is speaking for the other person, you know for them…"

R, T, d: "so that is a point of the platform, that we collect together lots of things and we're able to reflect commonalities and differences"

A , d: "I do fear that we are trying to create two projects in one. And that the content for one may not be the content that others would post for the other." A , d: "…there's either the public, and research does not quite tie together perfectly, and I don't know if that's just the articulation or that's just the stage that we're at with the project or what, but I think that something's missing if that is going to work."

A, P, d: "I think an information collection/sharing position that this information is being used for research, but why just keep it for the eyes of the researchers…it's akin to an autistic blog in a way"

R, T, d: "The thing that I wanted to maybe just dig into a tiny bit more is: …we did talk in a different breakout room about the fact that this platform is for research." R, T, d: "…[PA], I think that you articulated really beautifully why the point of the platform is not just to send experiences to researchers who will, over in their own space, do something with it"

A, d: "…at least for me, I think, avoid those negative discussions that we were talking about previously in our previous groups…the idea of really emphasising what this platform is for isn't just venting, it's for research."

A, d: "…you're obviously going to have a free text field at some point, where people can put whatever they want out of their brain, and I don't want to moderate that at all, because I think that it defies the purpose"

A, d: "…asking both the person who's writing it, and the moderator, to go, 'what's this about?'"

A, d: "…you worry if you're too specific, every comment is unique and there's no pattern, whereas if you can just pitch it at the right level whereby – and again this will be, I imagine by trial and error, but you get to a point where you can start aggregating different comments by different types, which is what the researchers are trying to do, to pick out common themes, you know, what's troubling people."

A, d: "…if the point of the research is so that it can go to people like the transport network, then it's less important how someone's meltdown felt [to you] or how it affected your day or whatever, and it's more important to think about, how do train stations be different so that this is less likely to happen, or easier for everyone to cope with if it does happen?

P , d: "…particularly for research…it needs to be the facts"
Sensory processing research

A, P , d: "They're [people online] claiming autistic people's responses to sensory difficulties are learned and behavioural."

A, P , d: "It's a huge, huge, issue, not helped by the fact that the ICD 11 doesn't even mention sensory, so when the DSM 5 came out, it did mention it, not as a core criterium of autism because non-autistic people can have sensory difficulties too, but to acknowledge that there may be sensory differences and that might give rise to repetitive behaviours and things need to be a certain way, but that wasn't even in the ICD 11"

A, P , d: "[not being a criterium in the ICD 11] fuels the lack of empathy and understanding as well, so projects around sensory issues are really, really important to garner that kind of understanding."

A, P , d: "…the sensory was highlighted as a priority by autistic people. Is this the one type of research happening, or is there other research looking at the more biological aspects of it?

A, P , d: "…there's a link between potassium and sensory overload in some people"

R,T, d: "I could answer very quickly that there is a lot of funding that goes towards looking at the biology of autism, including sensory processing, so that actually tends to be where resources are directed, is the biological aspects of autism"

A, P , d: "It was sensory specific, because I'm quite aware that a lot is going into looking for the autism gene, the very elusive autism gene?"

R, T, d: "…there are studies on the biology of sensory processing, and there's quite a lot of lab-based studies as well…what it's really missing is how it impacts on people's day to day lives and told from their perspectives."

P, A, d "…is this it? Sensory is one of the key problems…is this the answer or is there anything else going on about it as well? For example, understanding maybe the biology about it?"

A, R, A, d: "There is a lot of ongoing research about sensory issues beside this project"

A, R, A, d: "…when someone says…'put your panic on a linear thing, 0 is no panic, 10 is panic'… that's just on a line, if you put that as a body, where does that panic start, where does it move to, does it go back, does it journey – I think that's more meaningful. You know, a lot of researchers or psychologists often put this thing of measurement in these lines, and you know that kind of thing and temperature things and whatever. Because we've got this weird thing of the weirdly wired brain and the body that lets us know that we're in distress, it's how you marry the two in a way that people can relate and go –'well I'm experiencing this. This is happening in this part of the body, and that's happening there –'."

A, P , d: "…there are aggressive fields out there on social media that are claiming they're [sensory processing differences are] not even real.
Research Methods
Process

R, T, d: "I encourage everybody to write things down"

R, T, d: "I want to finish for lunch on time because it's a big day that you're spending with us so I want to make sure we can keep you fed and rested."

R, T, d: "[R]]'s great December is going to be to transcribe the workshop and to transcribe the breakout rooms that we had, so thank you to R that's going to be a lot of work, she's going to listen over and over to make sure she has your comments captured – and probably in the new year: it takes a while to do the transcriptions, we'll circulate summaries, so we try to anonymise some the quotes, so you'll probably recognise yourself but you other people shouldn't be able to recognise you, and we'll give them to you for review, so you'll be able to review that so if there's anything you do recognise and you think is inaccurate or that you don't want to be made publicly available, and then after that our work is to keep on keeping on keep building the platform and keep on embedding the some of the ideas, the warnings, the suggestions that you've given us into building the project, so thank you.

R, T, d: "Let me mute myself… if you raise your blue hand, I'll try to make sure I bring you into the conversation."

R, T, d: '…the reason we're mixing this group up is that we'd really like all of you to talk with each other, so each room should have at least one parent in it, you'll have autistic adults in it, and we'll really dig in hear into where there might be tensions"

A, R, A, d: "First to apologise, there might be some background barking, I will try to stop it as soon as possible after it starts"

A, R, A, d: "I'm not so used to this, I'm working from home"

R, T, d: '…so for previous discussions and what I'll do for this session as well is put direct and indirect next to every quote to say; if you're taking about, 'this is my experience', or 'my point of view', or 'my preference', then that would go under 'direct', but if it was something like, 'this is what my son would want', or, 'this is what autistic people like', or something like that, then it would be indirect – so it just carries a different weight."
Feedback

R, T, d: "…I had to certainly cut our discussion [autistic group] short"

A , d: "...I don't have a lot to say, to be honest, about what the takeaway is, I think most of the points have definitely been summed up"

R, T, d: "That's great, so you feel that you've had your views reflected and you've had a chance to say what you wanted to say?"

A , d: "Yes, I do"

P, d: "…I actually thought it was really useful to hear everyone's opinion, and how differently everybody is coming at it"

P, d: "I think it will be difficult to try and get everyone's input, try and make sure that everyone's voices are heard"

P, d: "I've found it really useful today. I've really enjoyed listening to people's different stories and seeing where it's gonna go"

R, T, d: "I am feeling like this has been such an amazing discussion"

R, T, d: I've learnt so much, and I think that the way of approaching the solutions to this really complex problem - to be honest I'd got into a bit of a tangle thinking, 'wow, how do I balance all these things.'

R, T, d: "…just hearing people empathise with each other and coming up with solutions, I now see actually quite a lot of routes forwards based on people's ideas."

R, T, d: "…just having this conversation available for research, I think just that in itself is wonderful because there's so much here. So thank you very much for sharing things, it's been really, really brilliant."

R, T, d: "I think it's the coolest part of the whole project has been being able to have these conversations. I'm very, very grateful for the advocacy that you're doing in your communities and the people you're supporting every day, and I'm really grateful for your time…thank you so much to RA"

A , R, A, d: "I had a really great time talking to you all"

R, T, d: "The project is a huge project, it's a massive piece of work, but it's nothing without these conversations and your very candid, kind thoughtful and empathetic input, so thank you everyone"
Participatory science and impact

A, P , d: "…this helps me to cross-fertilise into what I'm already doing as a disabled co-producer with my council. We have a new civil campus, which was made by a disabled design team, and I represent neurodiversity on it.

A, P , d: "I don't have necessarily mention autism all the time, but people have learned how I interact, and sometimes I come off camera, and I learned how to interrupt a presentation to say, 'why have you put that in red?', 'why is that there?', 'why is this not there?'"

A, P , d: "We've been put forwards for awards…because we were there right from the beginning, stage one, through to the build: so I interviewed contractors, inclusive architects, and I helped to find products, and all sorts of different things that I never thought I would do this time last year."

A, P , d: "…one of the [people] I'm working with this year is doing a presentation to a European group of architects who want to know more about how disabled people have advised on disabled inclusion for building design."

A, P , d: "I've even managed to get basins with no mirror behind it in all of bathrooms in all of the new town halls to cover people who are OCD, body dysmorphic, so they don't have to see themselves washing their hands umpteen times, or leaning across to put on makeup using my mirror. And I didn't have to do too much explanation of why there shouldn't be huge mirrors everywhere."

A, P , d: "I think it's because I've been doing this with Alan Turing and Autistica, that I've actually felt empowered to say the reasons why I've given that advice, and listening to other people's stories. So, the story telling's really important."

R, T, d: "I'm so glad to hear that A, and it's exactly that, being able to say directly to people "this is what will help the situation", and I'm so glad they were listening to you, and you were able to have that impact, that's really, really great"

A, d: "I was supposed to be part of a similar group at university, and they didn't listen to a single word we said!"

R, d: "That sounds wholly unideal, hopefully we can do a lot better."

# Moderation co-creation report

This folder contains a [report](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/moderation-co-creation) consisting of comments and recommendations from the AutSPACEs community concerning how we should moderate the AutSPACEs platform.
The dataset was created by organising the comments made during an online co-creation session to understand better the relevant issues around moderating an online citizen science platform (AutSPACEs) for research into sensory processing differences experienced by Autistic people and the effect this has on their daily lives as they navigate different environments.

## Key

The key below shows how the comments in the summaries have been labelled.
They were co-designed with an autistic collaborator and are based on earlier informal scoping work with Autistica's Insight Group.
More detail can be found in [creation-summary-documents.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/moderation-co-creation/creation-summary.md) file which describes in detail how the report was developed in collaboration with focus group participants and autistic collaborators.

## Moderation decisions regarding the data

A full, verbatim transcript of the co-creation session is held by the core research team.
This public dataset has been organised into themes and moderated so that it is aligned with the values of our community, and reflects the wishes of the individuals who are represented. 

All speakers were given the opportunity to read through the dataset and request changes before it was made public. A few minor edits have been made following discussions and 2 comments were removed which the speakers did not feel accurately reflected their views. 
Personal names have been removed and replaced with a label to identify the speaker's connection to autism (as shown in the key). 
We have also taken out references to specific locations, institutions, and organisations which might identify an individual. 
For the purposes of creating a public dataset which is autism-voice first, we have edited out comments which contain negative emotional responses, struggles, or judgements that non-autistic people have about autistic people, where the emphasis is on non-autistic people’s experiences (e.g. personal reactions to autistic people’s behaviours). 
We have kept comments about non-autistic people’s responses to autistic people, when the emphasis is on autistic people’s experiences (e.g. comments about dealing with neurotypical prejudice). 

Feedback from the AutSPACEs community, including from autistic people, autistic parents of autistic people, and parents of autistic people, has been predominantly that there should be an emphasis on autistic people’s experiences first and foremost, and that having too much focus on non-autistic views of autistic people can be damaging to autistic people, and work against creating a safe space for autistic voices to be heard.

**No edits have been made to how autistic people refer to and describe themselves, unless they have requested it.**
